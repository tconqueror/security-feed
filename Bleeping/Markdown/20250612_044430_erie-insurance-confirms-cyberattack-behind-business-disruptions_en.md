Erie Insurance and Erie Indemnity Company have disclosed that a weekend cyberattack is behind the recent business disruptions and platform outages on its website.

Erie Indemnity Company is the management company for the Erie Insurance Group, a property and casualty insurer with over 6 million active policies. The company provides auto, home, life, and business insurance policies through independent agents.

Since Saturday, June 7, Erie Insurance has been suffering from widespread outages and business disruptions, with customers unable to log into the customer portal and reporting difficulties making claims or receiving paperwork from the company.

Today, Erie Indemnity Group filed a [Form 8-K filing](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/922621/000092262125000023/erie-20250607.htm) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stating it detected "unusual network activity" on June 7, 2025.

In a similar notice on the Erie Insurance website, the company says it activated its incident response protocol in response to the attack.

"On Saturday, June 7, Erie Insurance's Information Security team identified unusual network activity. We took immediate action to respond to the situation to safeguard our systems and data," reads a [notice on Erie Insurance's site](https://www.erieinsurance.com/support-center/notice).

"Since Saturday, we have continued to take protective action for the security of our systems."

"We are working with law enforcement and are conducting a comprehensive forensic analysis with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts to gain a full understanding of this event."

When companies suffer a cyberattack, the usual response is to shut down systems to prevent the attack's spread to other devices.

Unfortunately, this response also disrupts applications and websites used to conduct business, impacting customers and business partners. It can take days, if not weeks, to fully restore service after a large-scale cyberattack.

Erie Insurance also warns that they will not call or email customers to request payments during this outage.

"During this outage, Erie Insurance will not call or email customers to request payments," reads an alert at the top of the page.

"As is best practice, do not click on any links from unknown sources or provide your personal information by phone or email."

Erie says the incident's full scope, nature, and impact are still being determined.

The company told BleepingComputer that policyholders who need to initiate a claim can contact their local agent or ERIE's First Notice of Loss team at (800) 367-3743. Erie Insurance also said customer care is available at (800) 458-0811.

No information has been shared regarding whether this is a ransomware attack or if data was stolen during the breach.
