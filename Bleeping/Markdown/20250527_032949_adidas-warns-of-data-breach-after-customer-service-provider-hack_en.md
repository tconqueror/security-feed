German sportswear giant Adidas disclosed a data breach after attackers hacked a customer service provider and stole some customers' data.

"adidas recently became aware that an unauthorized external party obtained certain consumer data through a third-party customer service provider," the company said.

"We immediately took steps to contain the incident and launched a comprehensive investigation, collaborating with leading information security experts."

Adidas added that the stolen information did not include the affected customers' payment-related information or passwords, as the threat actors behind the breach only gained access to contact.

The company has also notified the relevant authorities regarding this security incident and will alert those affected by the data breach.

"adidas is in the process of informing potentially affected consumers as well as appropriate data protection and law enforcement authorities consistent with applicable law," [it added](https://www.adidas-group.com/en/data-security-information).

"We remain fully committed to protecting the privacy and security of our consumers, and sincerely regret any inconvenience or concern caused by this incident."

Adidas has yet to reveal further details regarding this incident, including the name of the impacted service provider, when the incident was detected, how many individuals were affected, and if its own network was compromised during the attack.

BleepingComputer reached out to Adidas with questions about the incident, but a response was not immediately available.
