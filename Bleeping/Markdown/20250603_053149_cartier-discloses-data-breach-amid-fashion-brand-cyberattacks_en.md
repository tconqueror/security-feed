Luxury fashion brand Cartier is warning customers it suffered a data breach that exposed customers' personal information after its systems were compromised.

In notification letters sent today and shared by recipients on [social media](https://x.com/%5Fcountry%5Faccent/status/1929652281563062285), Cartier revealed that hackers breached its systems and stole a limited amount of customer information.

"We are writing to inform you that an unauthorized-party gained temporary access to our system and obtained limited client information," Cartier stated in the data breach notification.

"We contained the issue and have further enhanced the protection of our systems and data."

According to the company, the compromised information includes names, email addresses, and countries where the customer resides.

Cartier stresses that the breach did not include more sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or banking details.

However, the company warns that the stolen data could be used in targeted attacks, asking customers to remain vigilant against unsolicited or suspicious communications.

"Given the nature of the data, we recommend that you remain alert for any unsolicited communications or any other suspicious correspondence," the company added.

Cartier says it has informed law enforcement about the incident and is working with an external cybersecurity company to remediate the breach.

BleepingComputer contacted Cartier to learn more about the breach, such as when it occurred and how many people were impacted, but has not received a reply at this time.

## Fashion brands under attack

This breach follows similar security incidents at other fashion brands disclosed last month.

In May, [Dior disclosed a data breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fashion-giant-dior-discloses-cyberattack-warns-of-data-breach/) after threat actors breached its systems and stole customer contact details, purchase histories, and preferences. 

Also last month, [Adidas warned customers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/adidas-warns-of-data-breach-after-customer-service-provider-hack/) about a data breach resulting from a compromise at one of its third-party service providers. The attackers accessed contact information but did not obtain any payment details or account credentials.

Like Cartier and Dior, Adidas has launched an investigation with cybersecurity experts.
