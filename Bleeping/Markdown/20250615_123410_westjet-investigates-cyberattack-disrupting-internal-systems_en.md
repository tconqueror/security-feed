WestJet, Canada's second-largest airline, is investigating a cyberattack that has disrupted access to some internal systems as it responds to the breach.

"WestJet is aware of a cybersecurity incident involving internal systems and the WestJet app, which has restricted access for several users," reads a [security advisory](https://www.westjet.com/en-ca/news/2025/advisory--cybersecurity-incident-) on WestJet's site.

"We have activated specialized internal teams in cooperation with law enforcement and Transport Canada to investigate the matter and limit impacts."

"We are expediting efforts to maintain the safety of our operation and safeguard sensitive data and personal information for both our guests and employees, and we apologize to all guests for any disruption to their access to WestJet's services."

The attack also prevented users from logging into the website and mobile app, with those services now restored.

A Saturday morning update says the company's operation continues to run safely, but the attack has impacted access to some of its software and services.

It is unclear if the loss of access to its systems is caused by a ransomware attack that encrypted those devices or if they shut them to prevent the spread of the breach.

BleepingComputer contacted WestJet with questions about the beach but has not received a reply at this time.
