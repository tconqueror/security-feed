Microsoft announced in Berlin today a new European Security Program that promises to bolster cybersecurity for European governments.

The program expands to Microsoft's existing [Government Security Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/gsp), which is free to all European Union countries, including accession states, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members, the UK, Monaco, and the Vatican.

The tech giant noted that the program primarily aims to thwart attacks from state-backed actors in Russia, Iran, China, and North Korea, who have escalated their operations against the EU.

"Microsoft continues to observe persistent threat activity targeting European networks from nation-state actors, with Russian and Chinese activity being particularly prolific in Europe," [reads the announcement](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/06/04/microsoft-launches-new-european-security-program/).

"Nation-state actors, including those engaging in malicious activity from Iran and North Korea, are predominantly pursuing espionage objectives in Europe through credential theft or the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain access to corporate and government networks," mentions Microsoft in another part.

## AI at the center of cyber-defense

The key element of the program is the use of artificial intelligence to create actionable intelligence that will help in the timely detection and blocking of sophisticated attacks.

Microsoft will provide real-time AI-driven threat insights tailored to the needs of each nation, leveraging the program and expanding access to intelligence from the Digital Crimes Unit and Threat Analysis Center.

Moreover, Microsoft will supply updates on foreign influence operations using deepfakes and deliver early warnings and remediation guidance for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

Another important pillar in the new program is strengthening partnerships to identify new threats, develop defense measures, and disrupt cybercrime.

Microsoft will renew and strengthen collaborations with Europol, the CyberPeace Institute, LASR, and the Western Balkans Cyber Capacity Center, and will continue to support the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund. Also, it will work closer with internet service providers to advise on user-level remediation.

Microsoft highlights its recent role in the recent [takedown of the Lumma infostealer malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/lumma-infostealer-malware-operation-disrupted-2-300-domains-seized/) as a clear demonstration of its deepening commitment to protecting Europe's digital infrastructure.

The info-stealer operation had many infections in the continent, mainly in Spain, France, Poland, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
