Law enforcement authorities from six countries took down the Archetyp Market, an infamous darknet drug marketplace that has been operating since May 2020.

Archetyp Market sellers provided the market's customers with access to high volumes of drugs, including cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, cannabis, MDMA, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl through more than 3,200 registered vendors and over 17,000 listings.

Over its five years of activity, the marketplace amassed over 612,000 users with a total transaction volume of over €250 million (approximately $289 million) in Monero cryptocurrency transactions.

As part of this joint action codenamed '[Operation Deep Sentinel](https://operation-deepsentinel.com/)' (led by German police and supported by Europol and Eurojust), investigators in the Netherlands took down the marketplace's infrastructure, while a 30-year-old German national suspected of being Archetyp Market's administrator was apprehended in Barcelona, Spain.

One Archetyp Market moderator and six of the marketplace's highest vendors were also arrested in Germany and Sweden.

In total, [law enforcement officers seized](https://www.bka.de/SharedDocs/Kurzmeldungen/DE/Kurzmeldungen/250616%5FArchetyp%5Fabgeschaltet.html) 47 smartphones, 45 computers, narcotics, and assets worth €7.8 million from all suspects during Operation Deep Sentinel.

​"Between 11 and 13 June, a series of coordinated actions took place across Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, targeting the platform's administrator, moderators, key vendors, and technical infrastructure. Around 300 officers were deployed to carry out enforcement actions and secure critical evidence," [Europol said](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europe-wide-takedown-hits-longest-standing-dark-web-drug-market).

"With this takedown, law enforcement has taken out one of the dark web's longest-running drug markets, cutting off a major supply line for some of the world's most dangerous substances," said Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, Europol's Deputy Executive Director of Operations, on Monday.

In May, law enforcement [arrested another 270 suspects](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/police-arrests-270-dark-web-vendors-buyers-in-global-crackdown/) following an international joint action known as 'Operation RapTor' that targeted dark web vendors and their customers from ten countries.

During the same operation, police officers in Europe, South America, Asia, and the United States also seized more than 2 tonnes of drugs (including amphetamines, cocaine, ketamine, opioids, and cannabis), over €184 million ($207 million) in cash and cryptocurrency, and over 180 firearms.

The investigators identified the suspects (many behind thousands of sales on illicit online marketplaces) using intelligence collected following takedowns of multiple dark web markets, including [Nemesis](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darknet-marketplace-nemesis-market-seized-by-german-police/), [Bohemia](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/dutch-police-arrest-admin-of-bohemia-cannabia-dark-web-market/), Tor2Door, and [Kingdom Market](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-police-takes-down-kingdom-market-cybercrime-marketplace/).
