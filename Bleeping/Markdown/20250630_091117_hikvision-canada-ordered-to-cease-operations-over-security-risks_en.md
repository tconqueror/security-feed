The Canadian government has ordered Hikvision’s subsidiary in the country to cease all operations following a review that determined them to pose a national security risk.

The order was forwarded to Hikvision last Friday, and the matter was made public over the weekend by Mélanie Joly, Canada's Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.

“Following a National Security Review under the Investment Canada Act, the Government of Canada has ordered Hikvision Canada Inc. to cease all operations in Canada and close its Canadian business,” reads the [announcement](http://x.com/melaniejoly/status/1938771436988137969).

“The government has determined that Hikvision Canada Inc.’s continued operations in Canada would be injurious to Canada’s national security.”

While Canadian authorities did not share the findings leading to the decision, they say that the ruling is based on a multi-step review of information and evidence provided by the country's security and intelligence community.

Apart from banning Hikvision Canada's operations, the decision also bans all government organizations and crown corporations from buying and using Hikvision equipment.

Hikvision Canada Inc. is the Canadian subsidiary of Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd., the world’s largest manufacturer of video surveillance equipment.

Launched in 2014, Hikvision Canada has maintained a strong market presence in the country, supplying cost-effective end-to-end security and Artificial Intelligence with the Internet of Things (AIoT) solutions that cover IP cameras, facial detection, intrusion alerts, smart home devices, industrial automation, and building management systems.

Hikvision has faced regulatory scrutiny worldwide in recent years based on its ties to the Chinese government and the potential of its devices serving as a medium for collecting intelligence and for espionage.

Though solid evidence of such allegations has not been published, multiple governments, [including the US](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-bans-sales-of-huawei-hikvision-zte-and-dahua-equipment/), have banned the sale of Hikvision products based on security reviews.

Responding to the latest development in Canada, Hikvision has issued a statement condemning the decision and calling the allegations unfounded and politically motivated.

“We strongly disagree with this decision and view it with deep concern, as we believe it lacks a factual basis, procedural fairness, and transparency,” [responded Hikvision](https://www.hikvision.com/ca-en/newsroom/latest-news/2025/our-response-to-the-government-of-canada-s-order-to-shut-down-hi/).

“Instead of evaluating our technology on its cybersecurity merits, the decision appears to be driven by the parent company’s country of origin, reflecting broader geopolitical tensions and an unjustified bias against Chinese companies.”

The firm also notes that, during the security review, it responded to all of Canada’s requests for information with speed and transparency but never received evidence that substantiated the decision to ban its products in the country.

It is important to clarify that Canada’s latest action restricts to government's use of Hikvision products and does not apply to products made by Hikvision affiliates outside of Canada.

However, authorities “strongly encourage” all Canadians to take note of the conclusion and make their own decision when choosing surveillance equipment.
