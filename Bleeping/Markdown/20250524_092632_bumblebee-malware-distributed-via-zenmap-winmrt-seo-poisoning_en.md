# Fake Zenmap. WinMRT sites target IT staff with Bumblebee malware

The Bumblebee malware SEO poisoning campaign uncovered earlier this week [aimpersonating RVTools](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trojanized-rvtools-push-bumblebee-malware-in-seo-poisoning-campaign/) is using more typosquatting domains mimicking other popular open-source projects to infect devices used by IT staff.

BleepingComputer was able to find two cases leveraging the notoriety of Zenmap, the GUI for the Nmap network scanning tool, and the WinMTR tracerout utility.

Both of these tools are commonly used by IT staff to diagnose or analyze network traffic, requiring administrative privileges for some of the features to work. This makes users of these tools prime targets for threat actors looking to breach corporate networks and spread laterally to other devices.

The Bumblebee malware loader has been pushed through at least two domains - zenmap[.]pro and winmtr[.]org. While the latter is currently offline, the former is still online and shows a fake blog page about Zenmap when visited directly.

When users are redirected to zenmap[.]pro from search results, though, it shows a clone of the legitimate website for the nmap (Network Mapper) utility:

The two sites received traffic through SEO poisoning and rank high in Google and Bing search results for the associated terms.

BleepingComputer's tests show that if you visit the fake Zenmap site directly, it shows several AI-generated articles instead, as seen in the image below:

The payloads delivered through the download section ‘zenmap-7.97.msi’ and ‘WinMTR.msi’, and they both evade detection from most antivirus engines on VirusTotal \[[1](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/5afe56d224c629d7b7b3c496665ecf373323c4afa44f6701d1924e44448d08c1),[ 2](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/02197c23af1f99c3fa41d52f7f925e47ae5bfb5e604314d19382b1bb7112463f)\].

The installers deliver the promised application along with a malicious DLL, as in the case of RVTools, which drops a [Bumblebee loader](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/783a4034e44f58427a248454ade7ab09c4099414bb0a385ca32d8b263cd21ae4/detection) on users' devices.

From there, the backdoor can be used to profile the victim and introduce additional payloads, which may include infostealers, ransomware, and other types of malware.

Apart from the open-source tools mentioned above, BleepingComputer has also seen the same campaign targeting users looking for Hanwha security camera management software WisenetViewer.

Cyjax’s researcher [Joe Wrieden also spotted](https://www.cyjax.com/resources/blog/a-sting-on-bing-bumblebee-delivered-through-bing-seo-poisoning-campaign/) a trojanized version of the video management software Milestone XProtect being part of the same campaign, the malicious installers being delivered ‘milestonesys[.]org’ (online).

## Official RVTools still offline

Both official RVTools domains - Robware.net and RVTools.com - are currently showing a warning for users not to download the software from unofficial sites but don't make available the download link themselves.

Following allegations that the official RVTools site pushed a malware-laced installer, Dell Technologies [denied the accusation](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trojanized-rvtools-push-bumblebee-malware-in-seo-poisoning-campaign/) saying that its sites did not distribute a trojanized variant of the product.

Dell stated that the official RVTools sites were taken offline because they were being the targets of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

One explanation for the attacks would be that the threat actor behind Bumblebee decided to take down the official download portals to drive to the malicious sites users searching for alternative sources for the tool.

To mitigate the risk of installing trojanized versions of legitimate software, the best recommendation is to make sure to get it from official sources and package managers.

It is also worth checking the downloaded [installer's hash](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0506126bcbc4641d41c138e88d9ea9f10fb65f1eeab3bff90ad25330108b324c) with a known, clean version before running it.
