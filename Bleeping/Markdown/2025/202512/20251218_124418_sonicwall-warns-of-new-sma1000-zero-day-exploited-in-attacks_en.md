SonicWall warned customers today to patch a vulnerability in the SonicWall SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) that was chained in zero-day attacks to escalate privileges.

According to SonicWall, this medium-severity local privilege escalation security flaw (CVE-2025-40602) was reported by Clément Lecigne and Zander Work of the Google Threat Intelligence Group, and doesn't affect SSL-VPN running on SonicWall firewalls.

"SonicWall PSIRT strongly advises users of the SMA1000 product to upgrade to the latest hotfix release version to address the vulnerability," the company [said in a Wednesday advisory](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2025-0019).

Remote unauthenticated attackers [chained this vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-of-sma1000-rce-flaw-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/) with a critical-severity SMA1000 pre-authentication deserialization flaw (CVE-2025-23006) in zero-day attacks to execute arbitrary OS commands under specific conditions.

"This vulnerability was reported to be leveraged in combination with CVE-2025-23006 (CVSS score 9.8) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with root privileges. CVE-2025-23006 was remediated in build version 12.4.3-02854 (platform-hotfix) and higher versions (released on Jan 22, 2025)."

Internet watchdog Shadowserver currently tracks [over 950 SMA1000 appliances](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/iot-devices/time-series/?date%5Frange=7&vendor=ivanti&model=epm&dataset=count&limit=100&group%5Fby=geo&stacking=stacked) exposed online, though some may already have been patched against this attack chain.

​SMA1000 is a secure remote access appliance used by large organizations to provide VPN access to corporate networks. Given their critical roles across enterprises, government, and critical infrastructure organizations, unpatched flaws pose a particularly high risk of exploitation.

Last month, SonicWall [linked](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-says-state-sponsored-hackers-behind-security-breach-in-september/) state-backed hackers to a [September security breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-customers-to-reset-credentials-after-MySonicWall-breach/) that exposed customers' firewall configuration backup files, roughly one month after researchers warned of [over 100 SonicWall SSLVPN accounts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-vpn-accounts-breached-using-stolen-creds-in-widespread-attacks/)compromised using stolen credentials.

In September, it also [released a firmware update](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-releases-sma100-firmware-update-to-wipe-rootkit-malware/) to help IT admins remove [OVERSTEP rootkit malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-sma-devices-hacked-with-overstep-rootkit-tied-to-ransomware/) deployed in attacks against SMA 100 series devices.

One month earlier, SonicWall [dismissed claims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-finds-no-sslvpn-zero-day-links-ransomware-attacks-to-2024-flaw/) that the Akira ransomware gang was hacking Gen 7 firewalls using [a potential zero-day exploit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/surge-of-akira-ransomware-attacks-hits-sonicwall-firewall-devices/) and tied the incidents to a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-40766) patched in November 2024.

Cybersecurity firm Rapid7 and the Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) later confirmed SonicWall's findings, saying the Akira gang is [exploiting CVE-2024-40766 ](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/akira-ransomware-exploiting-critical-sonicwall-sslvpn-bug-again/)to target unpatched SonicWall devices.
