Microsoft is working on a new Teams security feature that will analyze suspicious traffic with external domains to help IT administrators tackle potential security threats.

As explained in a Microsoft 365 roadmap update this week, the "External Domains Anomalies Report" will help admins protect their organizations without disrupting legitimate business communications.

The new tool will do this by analyzing messaging trends to identify sharp spikes in activity, communications with new domains, or abnormal engagement patterns with entities outside their organizations.

It will provide admins with insights from monitoring communication patterns and flagging any unusual interactions that could indicate data sharing or security threats.

"This new report helps admins proactively spot unusual or risky interactions with external organizations. By analyzing communication trends and detecting sudden spikes, new domains, or abnormal engagement patterns, it provides early visibility into potential data-sharing or security risks," Microsoft [said](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=536572).

"As external collaboration grows, this report delivers actionable insights to safeguard your tenant while supporting productive cross-organization work."

The feature will begin rolling out worldwide in February 2026 to standard multi-tenant environments on the web platform. However, Microsoft has yet to share whether this new feature will require additional licensing or will be included with existing Teams subscriptions.

Since the start of the year, Microsoft has announced that Teams will [warn users](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-adds-malicious-link-warnings-to-teams-private-chats/) when they send or receive private messages containing links flagged as malicious, and has been working to [enhance Teams' protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-to-protect-against-malicious-urls-dangerous-file-types/) against malicious URLs and file types.

It is now also rolling out new Teams features that will let users report messages [mistakenly flagged as security threats](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-teams-to-let-users-report-messages-wrongly-flagged-as-threats/) and [automatically block screen-capture attempts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-screen-capture-prevention-for-teams-users/) during meetings.

Microsoft will also add a new call handler to [speed up the Teams desktop client](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-boost-teams-performance-with-new-call-handler/), improving launch times and performance on Windows 11 systems.
