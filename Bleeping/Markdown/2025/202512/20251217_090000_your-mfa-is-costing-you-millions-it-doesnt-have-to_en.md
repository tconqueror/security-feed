# Your MFA Is Costing You Millions. It Doesn't Have To.

_Token’s Wireless Biometrics Pay for Themselves Starting Day One_

For nearly twenty years enterprises have been told the same thing. Authentication is a cost center. Password resets burn IT time. Authenticator apps interrupt employees. MFA deployments cost real money but still fail against common attacks. Meanwhile attackers have evolved far faster than the technologies meant to stop them. They no longer break in.

They simply log in using phishing, spoofed portals, session relays, and social engineering. This has produced a strange reality where every year organizations spend more and yet credential attacks keep rising.

A new authentication model is changing both sides of this equation. Wireless biometric passwordless authentication, delivered through hardware devices such as [Token Ring](https://www.tokenring.com/biometric-authentication-ring?utm%5Fcampaign=32262752-Cmp%20-%20BleepingComp%20-%20MFA%20Costing%20You&utm%5Fsource=Bleeping-Computer&utm%5Fmedium=Article) and [Token BioStick](https://www.tokenring.com/token-biosticks?utm%5Fcampaign=32262752-Cmp%20-%20BleepingComp%20-%20MFA%20Costing%20You&utm%5Fsource=Bleeping-Computer&utm%5Fmedium=Article), is cutting login time, reducing workplace friction, eliminating identity-driven intrusions, and returning measurable productivity to the business.

For the first time a security technology not only protects the enterprise but produces a meaningful financial return from the first day it is deployed.

## The Productivity Drain Hidden in Plain Sight

Very few organizations have ever calculated the real cost of slow authentication. A password here, a code there, a retry after a mistyped digit. Each moment feels trivial until you apply it across the entire workforce.

Today the average login consumes twenty two seconds. Employees authenticate about twenty times a day across internal systems, cloud platforms, VPNs, and security tools. Those twenty two second logins multiplied by twenty events equal 440 seconds per day.

That is more than seven lost minutes per employee per day for access they are already entitled to.

With an average labor cost of fifty dollars per hour, those wasted 440 seconds equal $6.11 in daily lost productivity. Over a year the total exceeds $1600 per employee.

This is not theoretical. This is the daily cost of passwords and app based MFA across every industry.

This ebook examines how traditional MFA methods fail both security and usability tests, and what organizations should consider when moving to authentication models that reduce attack exposure and operational drag.

## What Happens When Login Time Drops to Two Seconds

With Token’s wireless biometric authentication, the entire process collapses into a single fingerprint match. No password. No code. No prompt. No app. The average login falls from twenty two seconds to two.

This returns twenty seconds for every authentication. Over twenty daily logins that is 400 seconds of recovered productivity per person every day.

That is **$5.56** returned per day.  
That is **$122.22** returned per month.  
That is **$1,466.67** returned each year.

And this is before considering the cost of password resets, which shrink to almost nothing once passwords disappear.

Here is where the economics become impossible to ignore. [Token devices](https://www.tokenring.com/products?utm%5Fcampaign=32262752-Cmp%20-%20BleepingComp%20-%20MFA%20Costing%20You&utm%5Fsource=Bleeping-Computer&utm%5Fmedium=Article) are available in enterprise volumes as a subscription for under $100 per year.

When the organization gains nearly $1500 of productivity per employee, the return on investment approaches fifteen times the cost. Most CIOs, CISOs, and CFOs will never see another security technology with this kind of annual payback.

## Security Strengthens at the Same Time

The productivity gains alone justify the transition to wireless biometric passwordless authentication. The security improvements drive the point home even further.

Token makes the common identity based attack paths disappear.

* No passwords to steal.
* No codes to intercept.
* No push prompts to manipulate.
* No shared secrets.
* No judgment calls for the user.

Even the most advanced real time phishing kits fail because Token will not authenticate unless three conditions are met: the domain matches exactly, the user presents a live fingerprint, and the user is physically present next to the login device.

If an employee clicks a perfect phishing link, Token simply refuses to authenticate. If a threat actor calls the help desk pretending to be an employee to trigger a reset, they still cannot log in without the biometric fingerprint and the physical Token device. Even device theft is useless without the fingerprint.

The biggest ransomware events of the past year share the same root cause. Aflac, Ingram Micro, Hawaiian Airlines, Qantas and others were compromised through credential theft, MFA relay, or social engineering. Token collapses that attack surface. When credentials cannot be stolen or misused, attackers lose their easiest and most reliable entry point.

One prevented breach can offset the entire cost of the authentication platform for the next decade. Many organizations spend millions responding to incidents that would never occur if identity were properly locked down.

## A New Era for Authentication Economics

Authentication has always been treated as a necessary inconvenience. It was slow, expensive, disruptive, and still vulnerable.

[Token’s wireless biometric passwordless technology](https://www.tokenring.com/products?utm%5Fcampaign=32262752-Cmp%20-%20BleepingComp%20-%20MFA%20Costing%20You&utm%5Fsource=Bleeping-Computer&utm%5Fmedium=Article) breaks this cycle completely. Login time drops to nearly zero. Credential theft collapses. Password resets disappear. The business regains more than fourteen hundred dollars per employee every year for a technology that costs under one hundred dollars per employee.

Phishing-proof. Tamper-resistant. Biometrically bound. Proximity required.**

This is the rare moment in cybersecurity where a stronger security control also produces immediate financial upside. It signals a shift toward identity technologies that simultaneously improve protection, streamline operations, and pay for themselves faster than any security investment in the past two decades.

The passwordless future has been promised for years.
