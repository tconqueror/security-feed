Users accessing the SoundCloud audio streaming platform through a virtual private network (VPN) connection are denied access to the service and see a 403 'forbidden' error.

SoundCloud is a large audio distribution platform focused on user-uploaded content, built around independent creators rather than licensed music from major labels. It has at least [140 million registered users](https://prioridata.com/data/soundcloud-revenue/) and 40 million creators.

Due to its open, unmoderated nature, the platform has been banned in China since 2014, in Russia since 2022, and is restricted in Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and other countries. Because of this, users in these regions rely on a VPN or proxy solution to bypass the blocks.

The VPN connection problem when accessing SoundCloud has persisted for the past four days, as the platform announced today that it is working to fix it.

BleepingComputer independently confirmed the VPN connection issue after multiple users [complained](http://www.reddit.com/r/soundcloud/comments/1pn6556/soundcloud%5Fjust%5Fbanned%5Fvpn%5Faccess/) on Reddit.

In a statement for BleepingComputer, SoundCloud's senior director of communications Sade Ayodele said that "some configuration changes have caused some users on VPNs to experience temporary connectivity issues."

Ayodele confirmed that they are working to resolve the issues, as the platform also announced earlier today on social media in a post from the support team.

It is unclear what prompted the configuration changes and the company has not provided a timeline for when users will be able to access the service over VPN.

Reddit users have pointed out that the issue has been going on for four days now, preventing access to all accounts regardless of their membership status.

Some users have reported that specific services or server locations unlocked access to the service, though others who have tried the proposed workarounds reported little luck.
