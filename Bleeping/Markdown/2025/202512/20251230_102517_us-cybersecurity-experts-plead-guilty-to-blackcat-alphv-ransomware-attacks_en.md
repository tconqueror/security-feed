Two former employees of cybersecurity incident response companies Sygnia and DigitalMint have pleaded guilty to targeting U.S. companies in BlackCat (ALPHV) ransomware attacks in 2023.

33-year-old Ryan Clifford Goldberg of Watkinsville, Georgia (in federal custody since September 2023), and 28-year-old Kevin Tyler Martin of Roanoke, Texas, who [were charged in November](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-cybersecurity-experts-indicted-for-blackcat-ransomware-attacks/), have now pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct commerce by extortion and are set to be sentenced on March 12, 2026, facing up to 20 years in prison each.

Together with a third accomplice, the two BlackCat ransomware affiliates breached the networks of multiple victims across the United States between May 2023 and November 2023, paying a 20% share of ransoms in exchange for access to BlackCat's ransomware and extortion platform.

Goldberg is a former Sygnia incident response manager, and Martin worked at DigitalMint as a ransomware threat negotiator (just as the unnamed co-conspirator).

"These defendants used their sophisticated cybersecurity training and experience to commit ransomware attacks — the very type of crime that they should have been working to stop," [said Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-americans-plead-guilty-targeting-multiple-us-victims-using-alphv-blackcat-ransomware). "Extortion via the internet victimizes innocent citizens every bit as much as taking money directly out of their pockets."

According to [court documents](https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/26212062-digital-mint-sygnia-indictment/), their alleged victims include a Maryland pharmaceutical company, a California engineering firm, a Tampa medical device manufacturer, a Virginia drone manufacturer, and a California doctor's office.

While they have demanded ransoms ranging from $300,000 to $10 million, prosecutors said they were only paid $1.27 million by the Tampa medical device company after encrypting its servers and demanding $10 million in May 2023\. While other victims also received ransom demands, the indictment does not indicate whether additional payments were made.

As BleepingComputer previously reported, the Justice Department [was also investigating a former DigitalMint negotiator](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/doj-investigates-ex-ransomware-negotiator-over-extortion-kickbacks/) in July for allegedly working with ransomware groups. However, the DOJ and FBI did not comment on the investigation, and it is unclear if this case is related to it.

In December 2023, the FBI created a decryption tool after [breaching BlackCat's servers](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-disrupts-blackcat-ransomware-operation-creates-decryption-tool/) to monitor their activities and obtain decryption keys. The FBI also found that the BlackCat operation [collected at least $300 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-alphv-ransomware-raked-in-300-million-from-over-1-000-victims/) in ransom payments from more than 1,000 victims until September 2023.

In a [February 2024 joint advisory](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-cisa-warn-us-hospitals-of-targeted-blackcat-ransomware-attacks/), the FBI, CISA, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also warned that Blackcat affiliates were [primarily targeting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-cisa-warn-us-hospitals-of-targeted-blackcat-ransomware-attacks/) organizations in the U.S. healthcare sector.
