U.S. prosecutors have charged two Virginia brothers arrested on Wednesday with allegedly conspiring to steal sensitive information and destroy government databases after being fired from their jobs as federal contractors.

Twin brothers Muneeb and Sohaib Akhter, both 34, were also [sentenced to several years in prison](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/twin-brothers-sentenced-wire-fraud-conspiring-hack-us-department-state-and-private-company) in June 2015, after pleading guilty to [accessing U.S. State Department systems without authorization](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26336050-muneeb-sohaib-akhter-affidavit-2015/) and stealing personal information belonging to dozens of co-workers and a federal law enforcement agent who was investigating their crimes.

Muneeb Akhter also hacked a private data aggregation company in November 2013 and the website of a cosmetics company in March 2014.

After serving their sentences, they were rehired as government contractors and were indicted again last month on charges of computer fraud, destruction of records, aggravated identity theft, and theft of government information.

"Following the termination of their employment, the brothers allegedly sought to harm the company and its U.S. government customers by accessing computers without authorization, issuing commands to prevent others from modifying the databases before deletion, deleting databases, stealing information, and destroying evidence of their unlawful activities," the Justice Department [said in a Wednesday press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-virginia-men-arrested-conspiring-destroy-government-databases).

According to [court documents](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26336049-muneeb-sohaib-akhter-indictment/), Muneeb Akhter deleted roughly 96 databases containing U.S. government information in February 2025, including Freedom of Information Act records and sensitive investigative documents from multiple federal agencies.

One minute after deleting a Department of Homeland Security database, Muneeb Akhter also allegedly asked an artificial intelligence tool for instructions on clearing system logs after deleting a database.

The two defendants also allegedly ran commands to prevent others from modifying the targeted databases before deletion, and destroyed evidence of their activities. The prosecutors added that both men wiped company laptops before returning them to the contractor and discussed cleaning out their house in anticipation of a law enforcement search.

The complaint also claims that Muneeb Akhter stole IRS information from a virtual machine, including federal tax data and identifying information for at least 450 individuals, and stole Equal Employment Opportunity Commission information after being fired by the government contractor.

Muneeb Akhter has been charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and destroy records, two counts of computer fraud, theft of U.S. government records, and two counts of aggravated identity theft. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of two years in prison for each aggravated identity theft count, with a maximum of 45 years on other charges.

His brother, Sohaib, is charged with conspiracy to commit computer fraud and password trafficking, facing a maximum penalty of six years if convicted.

"These defendants abused their positions as federal contractors to attack government databases and steal sensitive government information. Their actions jeopardized the security of government systems and disrupted agencies' ability to serve the American people," added Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the DOJ's Criminal Division.
