The police in Poland arrested three Ukrainian nationals for allegedly attempting to damage IT systems in the country using hacking equipment and for obtaining "computer data of particular importance to national defense."

The three men, aged between 39 and 43, could not explain why they were carrying the electronic devices. They now face charges of fraud, computer fraud, and possession of devices and software intended for criminal activity.

According to the police, the Ukrainians "were visibly nervous" when officers stopped them and said they were heading to Lithuania while traveling around Europe.

"Officers thoroughly searched the vehicle's interior. They found suspicious items that could even be used to interfere with the country's strategic IT systems, breaking into IT and telecommunications networks," the Polish police says in a [press release](http://srodmiescie.policja.gov.pl/rs/aktualnosci/145521,Podrozowali-po-Europie-z-detektorem-urzadzen-szpiegowskich-i-sprzetem-hakerskim.html).

"During the investigation, officers seized a spy device detector, advanced FLIPPER hacking equipment, antennas, laptops, a large number of SIM cards, routers, portable hard drives, and cameras." \[machine translated\]

During questioning, the three individuals pretended not to understand more specific questions about the seized equipment.

The Flipper Zero device is a portable tool for pentesting and hardware hacking intended for education and security research purposes. It can interact with a range of radio frequencies, capture data delivered this way, or jam radio communication.

The device can read or emulate RDIF, NFC, and Bluetooth signals, and emulate input devices, such as a keyboard and mouse, which can be used to execute scripts.

Due to the device's extensive capabilities and relatively low cost, it has become popular among cybersecurity enthusiasts and for malicious purposes. While many other devices can perform the same function, widespread media attention and its use in attacks, has led to bans in [Brazil](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/brazil-seizing-flipper-zero-shipments-to-prevent-use-in-crime/), [Canada](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/canada-to-ban-the-flipper-zero-to-stop-surge-in-car-thefts/), and on the [Amazon online marketplace](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/flipper-zero-banned-by-amazon-for-being-a-card-skimming-device-/).

Another device was a K19 RF/GS detection tool used for finding hidden surveillance equipment. It is advertised as being capable to detect wireless signals (RF), GPS trackers, hidden cameras (via laser/IR), and strong magnetic fields.

The Ukrainians claimed to be IT specialists, and the police in Poland are considering multiple scenarios for the reason the three men came to the country.

Although the data on the seized storage devices was encrypted, officers from the country's Central Bureau for Combating Cybercrime (CBZC) were able to collect evidence.

Authorities have not shared any details about the cyber activities of the three men but announced the charges against them and detained them for three months pending trial.
