In 2023, the Ukrainian cyber police, the National Police, and international law enforcement partners began investigating a ransomware operation whose members carried out attacks on companies in France, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, and the USA.

This operation led to [the identification, seizure of devices, and arrest](http://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/international-collaboration-leads-to-dismantlement-of-ransomware-group-in-ukraine-amidst-ongoing-war) of multiple cybercriminals residing in Ukraine for their involvement in the LockerGoga, MegaCortex, Hive, and Dharma ransomware families.

In an announcement, Ukraine's National Police says the investigation also allowed them to identify a Ryuk ransomware member who specialized in gaining access to corporate networks and then handing it off to other members to steal data and deploy the ransomware.

"Through the analysis of the information obtained as a result of the investigative actions, it was possible to additionally identify a 33-year-old member of the group who was engaged in searching for vulnerabilities in the corporate networks of the victim companies," reads the [announcement](https://npu.gov.ua/news/zavolodivaly-koshtamy-svitovykh-pidpryiemstv-politseiski-zatrymaly-uchasnyka-khakerskoho-uhrupovannia-shcho-perebuvav-u-rozshuku-fbr-ssha).

"The data obtained by the hacker was used by his accomplices to plan and carry out cyberattacks."

While the name of the 33-year-old man is currently unknown, Ukraine says that the suspect was previously placed on an international wanted list by the FBI and was charged with numerous crimes by the United States.
