* **72% of GenAI logins occur via personal identities**, circumventing established corporate security controls and presenting significant access-management challenges.
* **60% of corporate account logins to GenAI tools lack single sign-on (SSO)**, creating vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
* **Only 11% of GenAI connections utilize fully secured corporate identities with enforced SSO**, highlighting a substantial area for security improvement.

These findings emphasize why enterprises need an updated, integrated approach to cybersecurity.
