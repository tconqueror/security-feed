Hawaiian Airlines, the tenth-largest commercial airline in the United States, is investigating a cyberattack that has disrupted access to some of its systems.

With over 7,000 employees, 235 average daily flights, and a fleet of over 60 airplanes, Hawaiian Airlines connects Hawai'i with 15 U.S. mainland cities and 10 other destinations across Asia and the Pacific.

The airline stated in a statement issued on Thursday morning that the incident didn't affect flight safety and has already contacted relevant authorities to assist in investigating the attack.

Hawaiian Airlines also hired external cybersecurity experts to assess the attack's impact and help restore affected systems.

"Hawaiian Airlines is addressing a cybersecurity event that has affected some of our IT systems. Our highest priority is the safety and security of our guests and employees. We have taken steps to safeguard our operations, and our flights are operating safely and as scheduled," the airline [said](https://newsroom.hawaiianairlines.com/releases/hawaiian-airlines-cybersecurity-event).

"Upon learning of this incident, we engaged the appropriate authorities and experts to assist in our investigation and remediation efforts. We are currently working toward an orderly restoration and will provide updates as more information is available."

A banner on the airline's website notes that the incident hasn't impacted flights in any way and that travel hasn't been affected.

The same alert is also displayed on the Alaska Airlines website, which is owned by Alaska Air Group, a company that [acquired](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/business/alaska-airlines-hawaiian-acquisition.html) Hawaiian Airlines last year.

â€‹"There has been no impact on safety, and the airline continues to operate safely. We are monitoring the situation," the Federal Aviation Administration told [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/hawaiian-airlines-hit-by-cyber-attack-2025-06-26/) in a statement.

Currently, it is unclear whether Hawaiian Airlines' systems were affected by a ransomware attack that encrypted them or if they were shut down to contain a breach.

The airline has yet to disclose the nature of the attack, and no ransomware operations have claimed responsibility for the incident.

A Hawaiian Airlines spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer earlier today.

This incident [follows a similar attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/westjet-investigates-cyberattack-disrupting-internal-systems/) that affected WestJet, Canada's second-largest airline, on June 13, which prevented customers from accessing the airline's mobile app and website.

WestJet is also collaborating with third-party forensic experts to investigate the cyberattack and has engaged with law enforcement to fulfill its regulatory obligations.
