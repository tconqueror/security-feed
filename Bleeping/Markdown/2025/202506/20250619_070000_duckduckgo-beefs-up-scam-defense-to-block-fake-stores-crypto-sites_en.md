The DuckDuckGo web browser has expanded its built-in Scam Blocker tool to protect against a broader range of online scams, including fake e-commerce, cryptocurrency exchanges, and "scareware" sites.

DuckDuckGo is a privacy-focused web browser and search engine that doesn't track users' searchers or browsing history.

The browser, which became available as a public beta for [macOS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-for-mac-enters-public-beta-now-available-to-everyone/) and [Windows](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-for-windows-available-for-everyone-as-public-beta/) in October 2022 and June 2023, respectively, blocks all trackers by default, does not engage in personalized search profiling, and offers powerful anonymity tools.

Scam Blocker has been a component of the browser's privacy toolkit since its launch in 2018, protecting users attempting to visit known malware distribution and phishing URLs.

As part of the [latest update](https://spreadprivacy.com/p/b00d6763-b789-4e21-a0d6-fb35eed7acaf/), in addition to blocking phishing sites and malware, Scam Blocker now also detect and block the following:

* Fake e-commerce stores
* [Scam investment](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/cryptocurrency/us-seized-82-million-in-crypto-linked-to-romance-baiting-scams/) and crypto trading sites
* Survey scams with false cash rewards
* Scareware (fake virus alerts prompting [bogus tech support](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ftc-will-send-255-million-to-victims-of-tech-support-scams/))
* [Malvertising](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-says-malvertising-campaign-impacted-1-million-pcs/) (malicious tracker-powered ads)

When the user attempts to load a webpage, the tool scans the URLs locally against a continually updated (every 20 minutes) threat list supplied by cybersecurity firm Netcraft.

Rare or unknown threats are checked against DuckDuckGo servers using an [anonymous cryptographic process](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/threat-protection/scam-blocker#:~:text=How%20does%20Scam%20Blocker%20work%20anonymously%20in%20DuckDuckGo%20browsers%3F), ensuring that this process doesn't compromise user privacy.

When a scam site is detected, users are served a prominent warning message giving them the option to leave or ignore it and proceed to the risky site.

DuckDuckGo notes that, unlike Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, which rely on Google Safe Browsing and hence share data with Google, Scam Blocker offers privacy-first protection with no external data sharing.

Scam Blocker is activated in the browser by default and requires no account to work effectively.

Privacy Pro subscribers get a significant perk, as Scam Blocker will work across any internet apps on their devices when the [DuckDuckGo VPN](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-launches-a-premium-privacy-pro-vpn-service/) is active, covering other browsers as well.
