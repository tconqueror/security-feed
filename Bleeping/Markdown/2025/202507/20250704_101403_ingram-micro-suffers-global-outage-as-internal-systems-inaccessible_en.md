IT giant Ingram Micro is experiencing a global outage that is impacting its websites and internal systems, with customers concerned that it may be a cyberattack after the company remains silent on the cause of the issues.

Ingram Micro is one of the largest business-to-business technology distributors and service providers in the world, offering hardware, software, cloud, logistics, and training solutions to resellers and managed service providers worldwide.

The company employs around 24,000 people and generated approximately $48 billion in revenue in 2024.

Ingram Micro's outage started Thursday morning, with the website going offline and customers unable to place orders.

BleepingComputer was informed last night that some of Ingram Micro's internal systems are also inaccessible to employees.

Visiting the ingrammicro.com website now displays either a generic access restricted message from Akamai, a networking vendor used by Ingram Micro, or a maintenance message, shown below.

Ingram Micro customers [shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/1lqyayw/ingram%5Fmicro%5Fdown/) that the company is being silent as to what is causing the outage, with employees also left in the dark.

Some people claimed they were told a cyberattack, potentially ransomware, is behind the outage, but BleepingComputer has not been able to determine if these claims are valid.

However, an extended outage and the shutting down of internal systems are common indicators of a breach of some sort.

BleepingComputer contacted Ingram Micro about the outage and will update the story if we receive a response.
