analysisWe need to output the three separated sections. First, check/adjust markdown formatting. Original seems fine but we may want to ensure consistent heading. The title line and image alt syntax etc looks proper. Maybe bullet list uses * correctly. Possibly wrap the image alt to proper markdown? It's fine.

We may keep as is. Probably okay.

Second, translate content into Vietnamese, preserving code blocks unchanged. There's no code blocks in the article. But there are URLs in brackets. Should keep them. Keep technical keywords in English: Citrix, NetScaler ADC, NetScaler Gateway, CVE-2025-7775, CISA, Shadowserver Foundation, etc. We translate rest. Avoid translating URLs. Keep image links.

Third, extract key points focusing on deep technical aspects. Must be bullet list in Vietnamese.

Let's craft the translation. We must not translate within code blocks but there aren't code blocks; but might be indented code? None. Just plain.

We should review for consistency. Provide markdown style.

Let's produce.

# Over 28,000 Citrix devices vulnerable to new exploited RCE flaw  
![Citrix](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2022/11/08/citrix-stars.jpg)  

More than 28,200 Citrix instances are vulnerable to a critical remote code execution vulnerability tracked as CVE-2025-7775 that is already being exploited in the wild.  

The vulnerability affects NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway and the [vendor addressed it](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/citrix-fixes-critical-netscaler-rce-flaw-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/) in updates released yesterday.  

According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Citrix, the security issue has been exploited as a zero‑day vulnerability.  

The versions affected by CVE-2025-7775 are 14.1 before 14.1‑47.48, 13.1 before 13.1‑59.22, 13.1‑FIPS/NDcPP before 13.1‑37.241‑FIPS/NDcPP, and 12.1‑FIPS/NDcPP up to 12.1‑55.330‑FIPS/NDcPP.  

Citrix does not provide any mitigations or workarounds and urges admins to upgrade the firmware immediately.  

Internet scans conducted by the threat monitoring platform The Shadowserver Foundation soon after the flaw was disclosed show that there were [more than 28,000 Citrix instances](http://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/time-series/?date%5Frange=7&source=http%5Fvulnerable&source=http%5Fvulnerable6&tag=cve-2025-7775%2B&dataset=unique%5Fips&limit=100&group%5Fby=geo&stacking=stacked&auto%5Fupdate=on) vulnerable to CVE-2025-7775.  

Most of the vulnerable instances are [located](https://dashboard.shadowserver.org/statistics/combined/tree/?date%5Frange=1&source=exchange&source=exchange6&source=http%5Fvulnerable&source=http%5Fvulnerable6&tag=cve-2025-7775%2B&data%5Fset=count&scale=log&auto%5Fupdate=on) in the United States (10,100), followed by Germany (4,300), the United Kingdom (1,400), the Netherlands (1,300), Switzerland (1,300), Australia (880), Canada (820), and France (600).

Citrix did not share indicators of compromise associated with the exploitation activity.  

However, the vendor specifies that CVE-2025-7775 affects NetScaler when configured as a Gateway/AAA virtual server (VPN, ICA Proxy, CVPN, RDP Proxy), as LB virtual servers (HTTP/SSL/HTTP_QUIC) bound to IPv6 or DBS IPv6 services, or as a CR virtual server with type HDX.  

In any case, admins are recommended to upgrade to one of the following releases, which address the issue:

* 14.1‑47.48 and later
* 13.1‑59.22 and later
* 13.1‑FIPS / 13.1‑NDcPP 13.1‑37.241 and later
* 12.1‑FIPS / 12.1‑NDcPP 12.1‑55.330 and later  

Citrix also disclosed two other, high‑severity flaws in its security bulletin: CVE‑2025‑7776 (memory overflow denial‑of‑service) and CVE‑2025‑8424 (improper access control on the management interface).  

It is noted that versions 12.1 and 13.0 (non‑FIPS/NDcPP) are also vulnerable; however, they have reached End of Life status, so customers still using these versions must upgrade to a supported release.  

CISA has already added the critical CVE‑2025‑7775 vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. The agency is giving federal agencies until August 28 to apply the patches from the vendor or quit using the affected products, underlining the severity of the issue and the risk associated with exploitation.
