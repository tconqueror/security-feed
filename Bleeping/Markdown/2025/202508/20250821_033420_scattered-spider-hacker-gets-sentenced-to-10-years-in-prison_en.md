Noah Michael Urban, a key member of the Scattered Spider cybercrime collective, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Wednesday after pleading guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy [in April](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flmd.422789/gov.uscourts.flmd.422789.66.0.pdf).

He was arrested [in January 2024](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/palm-coast-man-arrested-wire-fraud-and-aggravated-identity-theft-charges), and in November, the U.S. Justice Department [charged Urban](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-charges-five-linked-to-scattered-spider-cybercrime-gang/) (also known as King Bob, Gustavo Fring, Elijah, and Sosa), along with four other suspects linked to the same financially motivated cybercrime group. The charges included wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.

According to [court documents](https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25355101-usa-v-buchanan-complaint-redacted/), they were able to steal millions from cryptocurrency wallets between September 2021 and April 2023, using credentials stolen in SMS phishing attacks targeting dozens of individuals and companies.

They also used credentials stolen from hacked companies' employees to loot confidential data, including databases, personal identifying information, as well as "confidential work product, intellectual property" from their systems.

All this stolen information was later used to hijack victims' email accounts in SIM swap attacks, allowing them to gain control of their phone numbers and cryptocurrency wallets to transfer millions to wallets under their control.

In a May 2023 interview with investigators, Urban stated that he had made "several million dollars" from cryptocurrency theft between January 2021 and March 2023, in addition to being involved in the theft of several million more, adding he still had a few million left after losing most of his earnings on gambling sites.

As [News4Jax first reported](https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2025/08/20/palm-coast-man-linked-to-scattered-spider-cybercrime-gang-sentenced-to-10-years-for-cryptocurrency-theft/), Urban received a 120-month prison sentence, despite prosecutors having only requested eight years, and will also be required to pay $13 million in restitution to the victims.

When investigative journalist Brian Krebs [contacted Urban on Twitter](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/sim-swapper-scattered-spider-hacker-gets-10-years/) after the sentencing, Urban responded from a county jail in Florida, stating that he believed the sentence was unjust. He argued that the judge had not considered his age as a mitigating factor because another Scattered Spider member had hacked the judge during the case.

More recently, the threat actors have shifted their focus from targeting [retail](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-scattered-spider-switches-targets-to-us-retail-chains/) and [insurance companies](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-warns-scattered-spider-hackers-now-target-us-insurance-companies/) to [the aviation and transportation industries](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scattered-spider-hackers-shift-focus-to-aviation-transportation-firms/).

U.K. police [arrested another member of Scattered Spider](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-arrests-suspected-scattered-spider-hacker-linked-to-mgm-attack/) in July 2024, a 17-year-old suspect believed to have been involved in the 2023 [MGM Resorts ransomware attack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/mgm-resorts/). In December 2024, U.S. authorities [arrested another teenager](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-arrests-scattered-spider-suspect-linked-to-telecom-hacks/) (a 19-year-old known online as "remi" also linked to Scattered Spider), charging him with breaching a U.S. financial institution and two unnamed telecommunications firms.
