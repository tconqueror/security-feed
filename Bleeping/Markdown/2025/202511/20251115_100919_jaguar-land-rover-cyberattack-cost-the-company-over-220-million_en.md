Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) published its financial results for July 1 to September 30, warning that the cost of a recent cyberattack totaled £196 million ($220 million) in the quarter.

The cyberattack was [announced on September 2, 2025](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyberattack-severely-disrupted-production/), forcing the British carmaker to shut down production at major plants and send its staff home. A follow-up statement confirmed that [data had been stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-jlr-confirms-data-theft-after-recent-cyberattack/) during the cyberattack, which was claimed on Telegram by the cybercrime Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.

The disruption [continued for weeks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-extends-shutdown-after-cyberattack-by-another-week/), stressing the company's financial and market position and raising risks for it and some of its suppliers, who faced severe liquidity issues.

On September 29, 2025, the [UK Government intervened](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-govt-backs-jlr-with-15-billion-loan-guarantee-after-cyberattack/) to pull JLR out of its dire position, approving a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to help restore its supply chain and quickly restart production.

Production restarted by October 8, 2025, following a phased approach.

Based on the financial results JLR has now published, the cyberattack, which halted production and disrupted sales, also created a significant dent in its profits.

"Loss before tax and exceptional items was £(485)m for Q2 and £(134)m for H1, down from a profit of £398m and £1.1bn respectively a year ago," [stated the company](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/11/jlr-performance-impacted-challenging-quarter).

"EBIT margin was (8.6)% for the second quarter, down from 5.1% a year ago, and (1.4)% for H1, down from 7.1% in H1 last year."

"This decrease in profitability is largely due to the cyber incident, the continuing impact of US tariffs, reduced volumes as referenced above and increased VME."

In its Monetary Policy Report published earlier this week, [the Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2025/november-2025) declared that the country's GDP was weaker than expected in Q3 2025, mentioning the cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover as one of the key reasons.

Despite all that, JLR states that its operations have now stabilized, with wholesale, parts logistics, and supplier financing now fully restored.

The company also highlighted that investment spending has not been cut despite the disruptions, and it is expected to remain at £18 billion over the five years from FY24.
