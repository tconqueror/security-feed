## NordVPN: The best Black Friday deal of 2025

The top promo this year is [NordVPN’s 2-year plan](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/cgo/nordvpn-black-friday-ros/p/nordvpn-black-friday-deal-2025/l/inline/). It is available with a massive 77% discount plus three extra months free. Best of all? [NordVPN’s Black Friday pricing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/cgo/nordvpn-black-friday-ros/p/nordvpn-black-friday-deal-2025/l/inline/) immediately surpasses VPN promotions advertised by competing providers.

In 2025, NordVPN confirmed that its Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotion runs from October 16 through December 10\. That gives you nearly two months to grab the most impressive VPN deals of 2025\. 

Here’s what NordVPN had to say:

_"Black Friday is a busy time — and not just for shoppers. Cybercriminals are also highly active during this period, so remember to take the necessary steps to protect yourself online. NordVPN protects your online traffic with encryption, making you safer on every network and device."_

### Get the discount – with no strings attached

When you follow the link in this article, the Black Friday deal will activate automatically – no codes or hoops to jump through.

The deal brings the total down to just $80.73 for 27 months of NordVPN Basic. 

To put that into perspective, the regular subscription costs $12.99 per month, which means you’d normally pay $77.94 for just six months of VPN protection.

With this Black Friday deal, you’re getting well over two years of protection, unbeatable streaming access on vacation, and some of the best online security tools we have ever tested – for a fraction of the usual cost.

This is exactly why NordVPN’s Black Friday bundle is turning heads across the VPN industry. And why it’s easily the most competitive VPN offer we’ve managed to land on this season.

NordVPN’s Black Friday deals means you’ll get security, privacy, Netflix access, and WiFi privacy at the lowest cost.

## NordVPN bundle deals

[NordVPN](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/reviews/nordvpn-review/) didn't stop at its Basic plan this Black Friday. The leading privacy provider has also slashed prices across its premium bundles. This gives you access to the Ultimate Nord Security ecosystem at prices we’ve never seen outside the Black Friday window.

### NordVPN Plus

The first standout option for bargain hunters seeking better all-around protection is the NordVPN Plus subscription. 

This plan includes full VPN access, Threat Protection Pro (an always‑on security layer that blocks malware, phishing websites, intrusive ads, and trackers in real time, even when the VPN is disconnected), and Nord’s secure password manager.

This Black Friday, you can get this all bundled for just $3.89 per month: turning a standard VPN subscription into a full-blown online security suite, at a price point that beats most competitors' basic plans. 

If you’re looking for an online protection suite with reliable filtering against trackers, ads, and malware, NordVPN delivers exactly that. It also includes a top-tier password manager that helps secure your accounts against hackers and phishing. 

What’s more, NordVPN’s pricing is unusually generous for the amount of protection you get. It’s genuinely rare to find such a comprehensive security bundle at a cost that beats what most providers charge for the VPN alone.

### NordVPN Ultimate

Hunting for the ultimate VPN deal of the year? NordVPN’s “Ultimate” plan is the centerpiece of its 2025 Black Friday event. 

Normally valued at $626.13, the 27-month Ultimate plan is currently discounted to just $159\. That works out to $5.89 per month, which is a massive 77% price cut.

Ultimate includes every service and feature that Nord Security offers. You get unlimited VPN use, the password manager, upgraded anti-malware and anti-tracking tools, 1TB of encrypted cloud storage, and even $5,000 in scam loss insurance through NordProtect. Just bear in mind that insurance is only available to US residents.

When you consider that Google charges $5 per month for just 1TB of cloud storage, Nord’s Black Friday pricing really comes out swinging! For only 89 cents more, you’ll get cloud storage _plus_ a VPN, password manager, advanced threat filtering, and identity theft protection.

For anyone looking to build a full security stack at the lowest possible cost, these Black Friday bundles are among the strongest tech deals of the year.

## Which VPN features does NordVPN come with?

No matter whether you choose NordVPN Basic, Plus, or Ultimate, you'll get full access to NordVPN’s complete VPN feature set. All core tools, including global server options, VPN protocol options, privacy settings, and security features, remain identical across all plans. 

The higher-tier bundles simply add extra services such as password management, advanced threat filtering, encrypted cloud storage, and identity protection.

That means you can stick with NordVPN Basic if all you want is a powerful, fast, and fully featured VPN. The upgrades are optional add-ons and will not change how the VPN itself performs. 

**Full NordVPN feature list:** 

* **Strong encryption of all traffic** (AES‑256 with modern VPN protocols like NordLynx/[WireGuard](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpn-wireguard/), OpenVPN, and IKEv2 for both security and speed).​
* **Protection against ISP or network surveillance** by hiding all browsing activity inside an encrypted tunnel.​
* **IP address masking** so websites and services see the VPN server’s IP instead of your real one, improving privacy and helping avoid IP‑based tracking.​
* **Location spoofing** lets you choose from thousands of servers in 127+ countries, useful for [bypassing geo‑restrictions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/location-geo-spoofing/) and regional blackouts.​
* **Ad blocking** at the server level to strip many ads before they reach your device (via Threat Protection/Threat Protection Pro).​
* **Tracking prevention** by blocking common tracking domains and cookies so advertisers and analytics tools collect less data on you.​
* **Malicious site blocking** that stops connections to known phishing, malware, and scam domains before they load.​
* **Malware download scanning** (on supported desktop apps) that checks downloaded files.
* **MultiHop VPN routing (Double VPN)**, sending your traffic through two VPN servers with two layers of encryption for extra anonymity in high‑risk situations.​
* **Tor over VPN** sends your traffic first through the VPN and then into the [Tor network](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpns-tor/) for stronger identity protection on .onion sites.​
* **Automatic [kill switch](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpns-with-kill-switch/)** that cuts your internet connection if the VPN drops, preventing any data from leaking outside the encrypted tunnel.​
* **DNS leak protection** by forcing all DNS lookups through NordVPN’s own DNS resolvers, so your ISP cannot see what domains you visit.​
* **Obfuscated servers** (NordWhisper / obfuscation) to hide the fact that you are using a VPN. Useful to connect on restrictive networks and to use the VPN in high-censorship countries.​
* **P2P‑optimized servers** for safer torrenting and other peer‑to‑peer traffic without sacrificing too much speed.​
* **Streaming‑optimized servers** (SmartPlay) that automatically use working DNS/routes to access major streaming platforms when they try to block VPN IPs.​
* [**Split tunneling**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpns-split-tunneling/) (on supported apps) so you can choose which apps use the VPN and which go directly to the internet—for example, routing only your browser through the VPN while games or banking apps use a normal connection.​
* **Private DNS servers** operated by NordVPN instead of your ISP’s DNS, reducing data exposure and some forms of DNS‑based censorship.​
* **High‑speed connections** (including 10 Gbps locations and NordLynx) to minimize the performance hit usually associated with VPNs.​
* **Support for up to 10 simultaneous devices** under one subscription, so you can cover multiple personal devices or family members at once.​
* **Optional dedicated IP addresses** so you can get a consistent IP (useful for hosting, remote access, avoiding CAPTCHA, and accessing strict streaming accounts).​
* **Native apps for Windows, [macOS](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpn-macos-sonoma-ventura-monterey/), Linux, Android, iOS/iPadOS, Android TV**, and many [smart TVs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/vpn/guides/best-vpn-smart-tv/), Amazon Fire TV/Firestick, Apple TV, and Apple Vision (via native/tvOS/visionOS support).​
* **Browser extensions** (proxy-based protection) for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.​
