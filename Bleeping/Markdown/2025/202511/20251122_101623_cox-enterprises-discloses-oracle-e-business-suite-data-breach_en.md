Cox Enterprises is notifying impacted individuals of a data breach that exposed their personal data to hackers who breached the company network after exploiting a zero-day flaw in Oracle E-Business Suite.

The compromise occurred in August, but the company didn’t detect the intrusion until late September, when it launched its internal investigation.

“On September 29, 2025, we became aware of suspicious activity involving Oracle’s E-Business Suite, which is a platform we use for some of our back-office business operations,” reads the notice.

“We learned the suspicious activity was the result of cybercriminals taking advantage of a previously unknown security flaw (called a “zero-day” vulnerability) in Oracle’s E-Business Suite between Aug. 9-14, 2025.”

Cox Enterprises is a major American conglomerate engaged in media (Cox Media Group), telecommunications (Cox Communications), and automotive services (Cox Automotive).

The company has 55,000 employees and an annual revenue of $23 billion, with its businesses having an international reach.

The company has not named the attackers, but the Cl0p ransomware has taken credit for exploiting CVE-2025-61882 as a zero-day vulnerability, long before [Oracle released a patch](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-patches-ebs-zero-day-exploited-in-clop-data-theft-attacks/) on October 5.

Cl0p hackers are known for leveraging zero-days in popular software products used by a large number of organizations.

Incidents where Cl0p exploited unknown vulnerabilities include the [Cleo file transfer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-claims-responsibility-for-cleo-data-theft-attacks/) in 2024, the [MOVEit Transfer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-claims-responsibility-for-moveit-extortion-attacks/) and [GoAnywhere MFT](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortra-shares-findings-on-goanywhere-mft-zero-day-attacks/) in 2023, the [SolarWinds Serv-U FTP](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-gang-exploiting-solarwinds-serv-u-flaw-in-ransomware-attacks/) in 2021, and the [Accellion FTA](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/accellion/) in 2020.

Breaches related to Oracle E-Business Suite have been confirmed by multiple companies, among them [Logitech](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/logitech-confirms-data-breach-after-clop-extortion-attack/), [Washington Post](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/washington-post-data-breach-impacts-nearly-10k-employees-contractors/), [GlobalLogic](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/globallogic-warns-10-000-employees-of-data-theft-after-oracle-breach/), [Envoy Air](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/american-airlines-subsidiary-envoy-confirms-oracle-data-theft-attack/), and [Harvard University](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harvard-investigating-breach-linked-to-oracle-zero-day-exploit/).

The threat actor added Cox Enterprises to their data leak website on the dark web on October 27 and published the stolen information.

Earlier today, Cl0p listed 29 new companies as their victims. The batch includes major organizations in the automotive, software, and technology sectors.

In the notification to 9,479 impacted individuals, Cox provides instructions on how to enroll in identity theft protection and credit monitoring services through IDX at no cost for 12 months.

The company did not specify what types of data were exposed in the notification sample [shared with authorities](https://www.maine.gov/agviewer/content/ag/985235c7-cb95-4be2-8792-a1252b4f8318/314b7585-15e4-4574-b102-6593275436d2.html).

Cox Communications suffered a separate [breach in June 2024](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cox-fixed-an-api-auth-bypass-exposing-millions-of-modems-to-attacks/), in which attackers exploited an exposed backend API to reset millions of customer modems and steal their personal data.

Earlier, in October 2021, Cox Media Group was [hit by ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cox-media-group-confirms-ransomware-attack-that-took-down-broadcasts/) that impacted live TV and radio broadcast streams.
