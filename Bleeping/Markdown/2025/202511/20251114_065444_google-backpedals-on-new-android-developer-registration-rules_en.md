Google is backpedaling on its decision to introduce new identity verification rules for all developers, stating that it will also introduce accounts for limited app distribution and will allow users to install apps from unverified devs.

As [announced in August](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-to-verify-all-android-devs-to-protect-users-from-malware/), Google was planning to introduce what it called "Developer Verification" starting in 2026 to block malware spreading via sideloaded apps sourced from outside the official Google Play app store.

The new rules require that all apps must originate from developers with verified identities to be installed on certified Android devices; otherwise, their installation will be blocked.

However, the announcement was met with widespread [backlash](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45742488) from Android [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1n1m699/horrible%5Fnews/) and [developers](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/1n7g0cc/to%5Fall%5Fandroid%5Fdevs%5Fspeak%5Fup%5Fnow%5Fbefore%5Fyou%5Flose/) (outraged by the registration process, which required them to pay a fee and provide government identification), who [organized](http://keepandroidopen.org/) to report Google to their national regulators and discourage others from signing up for Google's developer registration early access program.

F-Droid, the most popular third-party Android app store, also warned last month that Google's new registration could mean the end of the project.

"We do not believe that developer registration is motivated by security. We believe it is about consolidating power and tightening control over a formerly open ecosystem," [F-Droid said](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/f-droid-project-threatened-by-googles-new-dev-registration-rules/).

In response to the negative feedback, Google stated that it will "shape a dedicated account type" for developers who wish to distribute apps to limited audiences, such as family or friends, "without going through the full verification requirements."

The company also announced that it is developing a "new advanced flow" for experienced users with a higher risk tolerance who wish to sideload unverified apps. This new system will provide warnings about the associated risks but will ultimately allow users to make their own choices.

"We appreciate the community's engagement and have heard the early feedback – specifically from students and hobbyists who need an accessible path to learn, and from power users who are more comfortable with security risks. We are making changes to address the needs of both groups," [said Matthew Forsythe](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html), Director of Product Management for Android App Safety.

With these concessions in place, Google has started inviting developers distributing outside of the Play Store to [early access for developer verification](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/early-access) in the Android Developer Console, and also plans to invite Play developers to the program starting November 25.

Android developer verification will be open to all developers in March 2026\. Beginning in September 2026, apps must be registered by verified developers to be installed on Android devices in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, with a global rollout planned for 2027.
