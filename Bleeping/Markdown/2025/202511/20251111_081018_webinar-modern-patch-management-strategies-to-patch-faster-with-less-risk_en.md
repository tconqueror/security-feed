Unpatched vulnerabilities continue to top the list of root causes in major security breaches, and yet, most organizations still struggle to fix them fast enough.

On **December 2nd at 2:00 PM E**T, BleepingComputer and SC Media will co-host a live webinar with Gene Moody, Field CTO at Action1, exploring how modern patch management strategies can help IT and security teams finally get ahead of the vulnerability curve.

The webinar, "**[Winning the 2026 vulnerability race: Closing the gap between detection and remediation](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=84B6E94D-9C81-4F9B-841F-7D435B7FF576&utm%5Fsource=bleepingcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=bc%5Fprom%5Fart&utm%5Fcampaign=sc-cybercast-bc-2025-dec-a1)**," will examine why patching remains a persistent challenge and what new approaches can break the cycle of delay, complexity, and risk.

Action1 is a modern patch management platform built for today’s distributed, dynamic IT environments. By combining automation with continuous visibility and policy-driven workflows, Action1 helps teams prioritize risk, maintain compliance, and patch faster—without losing control.

Unlike legacy tools like Microsoft WSUS, which is now deprecated, Action1 offers a real-time, cloud-native approach that supports modern hybrid environments and addresses the limitations that made WSUS difficult to scale and maintain.

In this must-watch session, you'll hear practical advice and real-world examples of how organizations are shifting to smarter, more strategic patching—aligning remediation with business impact and freeing up resources through automation.

### Modern patch management bridges the gap in 2026

Despite the headlines, patching is still broken. Outdated processes, inconsistent prioritization, and poor visibility leave organizations vulnerable to breaches caused by well-known, fixable flaws.

This webinar will explore why legacy approaches fail and how modern platforms and workflows help close the remediation gap before attackers can exploit it.

### The upcoming webinar will cover:

* How to prioritize patches by business impact, not just CVSS score
* Why outdated patching practices persist—and how to break them
* How visibility and automation can accelerate remediation and reduce risk
* What policy-driven, compliance-aware patching looks like in real environments

The event will be hosted by Adrian Sanabria (SC Media) and Gene Moody (Action1), with BleepingComputer as co-host.

Don’t miss this opportunity to rethink patch management for 2026 and beyond.
