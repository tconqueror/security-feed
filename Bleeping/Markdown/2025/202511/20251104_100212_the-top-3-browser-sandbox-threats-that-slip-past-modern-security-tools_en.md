# The Top 3 Browser Sandbox Threats That Slip Past Modern Security Tools

In today’s enterprise environments, the browser has quietly become the most targeted and most overlooked application in the modern security stack.

Employees now spend **up to 90% of their workday** in the browser, using it to access sensitive SaaS apps, AI tools, and cloud systems that were once guarded by traditional network perimeters. Yet the browser’s built-in security measures, while essential, were never designed for the sophistication of today’s cyberthreats.

Keep Aware’s new on-demand webinar, “[The Browser Sandbox & Its Top 3 Threats: How Modern Browsers’ Security Isn’t Enough for Your Modern Security Strategy](https://keepaware.com/resources/webinars/the-browser-sandbox-its-top-3-threats?utm%5Fsource=bleeping%5Fcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=article&utm%5Fcampaign=top%5Fthreats%5Fwebinar%5Fnov),” takes a deep dive into the blind spots hiding in every organization’s browser layer.

The session reveals why modern browsers and traditional security defenses can’t stop attacks like credential theft, malicious extensions, and lateral movement, and what security leaders can do to close the gap.

## Why the Browser Sandbox Isn’t Bulletproof

Most browsers rely on a “sandbox” model designed to isolate browser activity and contain malicious code. But attackers have evolved to bypass sandbox restrictions by using expected browser behaviors.

We expect browsers to display web server content, run third-party code as extensions, allow user input, and download data. Attackers use these inherent features to carry out phishing attacks, leverage malicious extensions, and move laterally from the browser context to the host—effectively evading corporate controls.

The issue isn’t that browsers are insecure; it’s that **they were built for performance and usability, not enterprise-grade protection**.

The result? A security blind spot sits between the endpoint and the cloud, where traditional defenses like CASBs, SWGs, and EDRs have limited visibility.

The Top 3 Browser Threats You Need to Address:

1. **Credential Theft:** Attackers exploit social engineering and session hijacking to bypass MFA and gain persistent access to SaaS and AI platforms.
2. **Malicious Extensions:** Seemingly harmless extensions harvest data, inject ads, or act as backdoors for malware delivery.
3. **Lateral Movement:** Attackers use browser-native features to move their control outside of the browser context, where the impact leads to data loss, device compromise, and financial loss.

Keep Aware protects against the browser-layer attacks your security stack can’t see—credential theft, malicious extensions, and lateral movement—right where they happen: inside the browser.

By monitoring real-time user behavior, extension activity, and in-browser data flows, Keep Aware identifies and blocks threats before they spread across accounts or SaaS apps. Empower your security team with browser-level visibility, dynamic policy enforcement, and instant threat response, all without replacing the browsers your employees already use.

## Beyond Traditional Controls: Visibility at the Browser Layer

The webinar explores how enterprise teams can augment native browser defenses with **real-time visibility, policy enforcement, and behavioral detection**, capabilities that extend security directly into user activity.

Keep Aware’s lead threat researcher breaks down how browser-level controls can detect risky behavior (like clipboard injection), stop credential theft in real time, and fill the missing gap in current security stacks.
