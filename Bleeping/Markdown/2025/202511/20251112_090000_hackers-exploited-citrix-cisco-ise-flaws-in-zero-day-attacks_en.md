An advanced threat actor exploited the critical vulnerabilities “Citrix Bleed 2" (CVE-2025-5777) in NetScaler ADC and Gateway, and CVE-2025-20337 affecting Cisco Identity Service Engine (ISE) as zero-days to deploy custom malware.

Amazon’s threat intelligence team, analyzing “[MadPot](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/amazon-madpot-stops-cybersecurity-crime)” honeypot data, found that hackers leveraged the two security issues before the security issues were disclosed publicly and patches became available.

“Our Amazon MadPot honeypot service detected exploitation attempts for the Citrix Bleed Two vulnerability ([CVE-2025-5777](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5777)) prior to public disclosure, indicating a threat actor had been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day,” explains Amazon.

“Through further investigation of the same threat exploiting the Citrix vulnerability, Amazon Threat Intelligence identified and shared with Cisco an anomalous payload targeting a previously undocumented endpoint in Cisco ISE that used vulnerable deserialization logic.”

Citrix Bleed 2 is a NetScaler ADC and Gateway out-of-bounds memory read problem that the vendor published fixes for in [late June](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-citrixbleed-2-netscaler-flaw-let-hackers-hijack-sessions/).

Although the vendor [needed a longer period](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/citrix-bleed-2-exploited-weeks-before-pocs-as-citrix-denied-attacks/) to confirm that the flaw was leveraged in attacks, despite multiple third-party reports [claiming](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/citrix-bleed-2-flaw-now-believed-to-be-exploited-in-attacks/) it was used in attacks, exploits [became available](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/public-exploits-released-for-citrixbleed-2-netscaler-flaw-patch-now/) in early July, and CISA [tagged it as exploited](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-tags-citrix-bleed-2-as-exploited-gives-agencies-a-day-to-patch/).

The flaw in ISE ([CVE-2025-20337](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-20337)), with a maximum severity score, was [published on July 17](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/max-severity-cisco-ise-bug-allows-pre-auth-command-execution-patch-now/), when Cisco warned that it could be exploited to let an unauthenticated attacker store malicious files, execute arbitrary code, or gain root privileges on vulnerable devices.

In less than five days, the vendor reissued its warning about CVE-2025-20337 [being actively exploited](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-maximum-severity-ise-rce-flaws-now-exploited-in-attacks/). On July 28, researcher [Bobby Gould](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploit-available-for-critical-cisco-ise-bug-exploited-in-attacks/) published technical details in a write-up that included an exploit chain.

In a report shared with BleepingComputer, Amazon says that both flaws were leveraged in APT attacks before Cisco and Citrix published their initial security bulletins.

The hackers leveraged CVE-2025-20337 to gain pre-auth admin access to Cisco ISE endpoints, and deployed a custom web shell named ‘IdentityAuditAction,’ disguised as a legitimate ISE component.

The web shell registered as an HTTP listener to intercept all requests and used Java reflection to inject into Tomcat server threads.

It also employed DES encryption with non-standard base64 encoding for stealth, required knowledge of specific HTTP headers to access, and left minimal forensic traces behind.

The use of multiple undisclosed zero-day flaws and the advanced knowledge of Java/Tomcat internals and the Cisco ISE architecture all point to a highly resourced and advanced threat actor. However, Amazon could not attribute the activity to a known threat group.

Curiously, though, the targeting appeared indiscriminate, which doesn’t match the typically tight scope of highly targeted operations by such threat actors.

It is recommended to apply the available security updates for CVE-2025-5777 and CVE-2025-20337, and limit access to edge network devices through firewalls and layering.
