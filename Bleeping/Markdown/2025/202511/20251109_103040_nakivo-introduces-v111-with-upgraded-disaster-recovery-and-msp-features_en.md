## Expanded Backup Capabilities for Proxmox VE

Building upon the groundwork set in version 11, the v11.1 release brings major upgrades to [Proxmox VE support](https://www.nakivo.com/proxmox-backup/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com). Businesses can now achieve higher resilience without expensive infrastructure changes. The update includes:

* [Flash VM Boot](https://www.nakivo.com/features/instant-vm-recovery/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) for instant operational recovery in seconds.
* VM Replication to maintain uptime and ensure rapid failover in case of disruptions or data corruption.
* VM Template Backup and Recovery for consistent, fast deployment of pre-configured VMs.
* [Automated Backup Verification](https://www.nakivo.com/features/screenshot-verification/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) with comprehensive reports and screenshots.
* [Direct Recovery from Tape](https://www.nakivo.com/features/direct-recovery-from-tape/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) without a staging repository.
* Exchange and SQL Server [Log Truncation](https://www.nakivo.com/features/log-truncation/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) to improve efficiency and optimize storage use.

## MSP Direct Connect

Previously, connecting MSP systems with client environments required opening ports on the client side. With v11.1, the new [MSP Direct Connect](https://www.nakivo.com/features/direct-connect/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) removes that necessity, introducing a streamlined and secure connection model that simplifies onboarding and deployment.

All communications between the MSP Director and Client Transporter are fully encrypted to comply with rigorous security standards.

Support now extends beyond VMware and Windows/Linux machines to include Hyper-V and Proxmox VE, extending the capabilities of [NAKIVO backup for MSPs](https://www.nakivo.com/msp-backup/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) and enabling providers to manage hybrid infrastructures more efficiently than ever.

## Real-Time Replication for VMware

Now officially released, [Real-Time Replication](https://www.nakivo.com/real-time-replication/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) enables constant synchronization of VMware VMs with their live sources.

The setup is effortless: The solution automatically installs the IO Filter and Journal Service, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Admins can embed real-time failover in [Site Recovery](https://www.nakivo.com/vm-disaster-recovery/?utm%5Fsource=BleepingComputer.com) workflows to automate failover to the active replicas. During an outage, the Site Recovery job triggers immediate takeover, ensuring uninterrupted service and zero data loss.

All transferred data is encrypted over unsecured WAN links, providing robust protection against interception.

## Granular Backup for Physical Machines

Version 11.1 enables backing up selected folders or volumes on physical Windows and Linux systems, in addition to full-machine protection.

Granular backups can be saved to nearly any location—local drives, cloud repositories, deduplication storage, file shares or even tape—while supporting encryption, immutability and air-gapping.

Recovery is equally flexible: Data can be recovered to SMB/NFS shares, emailed or downloaded through a web browser. This selective approach enables quick and easy recovery of the needed folders or volumes.

## Driving Resilience and Accessibility

“This release turns NAKIVO Backup & Replication into a core asset for businesses aiming to navigate the complexities of data protection and management,” said Bruce Talley, CEO of NAKIVO. “With an interface supporting 7 languages, streamlined MSP direct connect, and seamless recovery and failover automation, v11.1 puts easily-accessible data protection within immediate reach—no matter the environment. v11.1 truly builds on our 13 years of backup and disaster recovery innovations.”

## Feature Availability

NAKIVO Backup & Replication v11.1 is now available for download.
