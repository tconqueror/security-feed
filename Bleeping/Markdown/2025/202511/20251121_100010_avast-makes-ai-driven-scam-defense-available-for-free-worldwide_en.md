A premium version, Scam Guardian Pro, has also been added to Avast Premium Security, giving customers an enhanced layer of AI protection against email scams.

"Today's scams aren't crude or obvious – they're tailored, targeted, and AI-enhanced, making it harder than ever to tell the difference between truth and deception," said Leena Elias, Chief Product Officer at Gen.

"As scammers take advantage of rising data breaches and leaked personal information, anyone anywhere can become a victim of scams. That's why it's never been more important to make powerful AI-powered scam protection available to everyone, everywhere. We're levelling the playing field with world class scam defense that helps people strengthen their digital and financial safety."

According to the recent [Q1/2025 Gen Threat Report](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4456450-1&h=2881209314&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gendigital.com%2Fblog%2Finsights%2Freports%2Fthreat-report-q1-2025&a=Q1%2F2025+Gen+Threat+Report), breached records of individuals surged by more than 186% between January and March 2025, revealing sensitive information such as passwords, emails, and credit card details.

Over the same timeframe, reports of phishing scams rose by 466% compared to the previous quarter, making up almost a third of all scam submissions observed by Gen.

As data breaches rise, so do the opportunities for attackers to exploit leaked information to launch targeted, hyper-personalized scam campaigns that are harder than ever to spot.

Like a seasoned scam investigator, Scam Guardian uses proprietary AI trained on scam data from Gen Threat Labs to go beyond just detecting malicious URLs—it also analyzes context and language to more effectively identify signs of deceptive or harmful intent.

Scam Guardian also helps to pull back the curtain on hidden threats in website code and neutralizes them to keep people safer as they browse and shop online.
