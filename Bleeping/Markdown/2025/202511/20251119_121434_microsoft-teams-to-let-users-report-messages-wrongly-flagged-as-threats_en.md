Microsoft says that Teams users will be able to report false-positive threat alerts triggered by messages incorrectly flagged as malicious.

This new feature was first announced in September, when it entered a targeted rollout phase, and will roll out to users worldwide by the end of November 2025.

"Microsoft Teams now enables users to report messages they believe were incorrectly flagged as security threats in chats and channels," Microsoft [said](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1147984) in a Microsoft 365 message center update.

"It empowers users to provide feedback on false positives, helping improve detection accuracy and strengthen organizational security."

False-positive user reporting will be available to organizations using Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft Defender XDR, and it will be accessible across desktop (Windows and macOS), mobile (Android and iOS), and web platforms.

Once it reaches general availability, this Teams feature will be toggled on by default; however, admins can also turn it on or off in the Teams admin center and the Microsoft Defender portal.

Last week, Microsoft started rolling out a new Teams feature for Premium customers that [automatically blocks screen recordings](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-rolls-out-screen-capture-prevention-for-teams-users/) and screenshots during meetings.

In recent months, Microsoft has also announced that Teams will [warn users](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-adds-malicious-link-warnings-to-teams-private-chats/) when they send or receive private messages containing links flagged as malicious, and has begun working to [enhance protection](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-to-protect-against-malicious-urls-dangerous-file-types/) against malicious file types and URLs in Teams chats and channels.

All these features are now rolling out worldwide and are expected to reach general availability by the end of November 2025.

During last year's Enterprise Connect conference, Microsoft [said](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-building-a-foundation-for-the-future/4090393) that over 320 million people use Teams each month across 181 markets.
