# Turn your Windows 11 migration into a security opportunity

Not all versions of Windows were created equal, at least not according to Windows users. Windows XP was a legendary operating system that Microsoft found hard to replace. It didn’t help that XP’s successor, Windows Vista, was basically an Edsel-level bust.

Nearly two decades later, Microsoft faces a similar, if less pronounced, dilemma. The days when the release of a new Windows OS could command a good chunk of mainstream media attention have mostly passed, but Microsoft’s end of support for Windows 10 in October 2025 did make a few ripples around the internet.

## It’s hard to replace a perfect (Windows) 10

Like Windows XP, Windows 10 is — was? — a beloved OS. As for Windows 11, which is somehow already four years old, the jury is still out. While it won’t come close to touching the depths to which Vista sank, it’s not exactly popular.

Instead of making the free migration to the “new” version of Windows, users are rethinking their options. Some want to stay on Windows 10\. Others are looking outside of Windows completely and moving to Linux.

In fact, after finally passing Windows 10 in market share among Windows operating systems in July 2025, Windows 11 actually started [losing market share](https://betanews.com/2025/09/07/as-windows-10-reaches-end-of-life-windows-11-is-losing-market-share/#:~:text=While%20Windows%2011%20remains%20more,45.53%20percent%20for%20Windows%2010.), a trend that continued [at least through September](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide/). But that’s not the weirdest market-share statistic.

This is: Windows 7, introduced in 2009 and long since left in the dustbin of history by Microsoft, rocketed up from a flatline of about 2% of Windows market share to nearly 4% in August and nearly 10% in September!

## What are the alternatives to Windows 11?

Users who just can’t stand Windows 11 do have options. Few are simple. Almost none are particularly safe. None will really work for businesses or service providers. (One word of advice: Don’t move to Windows 7.)

Continuing to use Windows 10 is an option. Microsoft is offering an [Extended Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/extended-security-updates) (ESU) for Windows 10 until October 2026\. But managing an ESU can become complicated and even potentially costly for businesses and quickly unmanageable for both service providers and their clients. (If Microsoft isn’t going to support Windows 10, MSPs probably don’t want to have to take on that considerable task themselves.)

In fact, the [Acronis Cyberthreats Report, H1 2025](https://www.acronis.com/en/resource-center/resource/acronis-cyberthreats-report-h1-2025/?utm%5Fsource=bleepingcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=bleepingcomputer-fy25-q4-mixed-amer-nam-en-ba-q4brandq4truba-x-bleepingcomputer-a) from the [Acronis Threat Research Unit](https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/?utm%5Fsource=bleepingcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=bleepingcomputer-fy25-q4-mixed-amer-nam-en-ba-q4brandq4truba-x-bleepingcomputer-a) found that unpatched vulnerabilities were the second-most common initial attack vector, behind only phishing, used against managed service providers (MSPs).

So, using an OS that’s no longer supported can be dangerous, particularly as [ransomware spreads like wildfire](https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/safepay-ransomware-the-fast-rising-threat-targeting-msps/?utm%5Fsource=bleepingcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=bleepingcomputer-fy25-q4-mixed-amer-nam-en-ba-q4brandq4truba-x-bleepingcomputer-a). Beyond that, most application vendors are likely to stop supporting Windows 10 versions of their apps in the weeks and months to come. Some will require users to move to Windows 11.

Moving to Linux has a certain rebellious appeal, and it might work for savvy users. But in a business or MSP setting, it’s far too big, complex and costly a project to even consider undertaking. It’s just not realistic for many users other than hobbyists and Windows haters. Besides, open source isn’t impervious to attacks.

It’s not even worth mentioning the idea of running a business or MSP with just Chromebooks, as a few outlets have suggested. It’s Windows or nothing for most businesses, MSPs and MSP clients.

## Use the Windows 11 migration as a security check

Windows 11, then, is something of an inevitability in most offices. So, why not make the best of it? Organizations should look at Windows 11 migration as an opportunity to assess their entire computing infrastructure: what works, and what needs improving. Now is the time to figure that out and adjust.

Think about cybersecurity, for instance. The most compelling reason to move to Windows 11 is to keep the computing environment safe.

So, go beyond OS migration. Ask some critical questions: Is your data backed up? Would it be available in case of a data breach, disaster or other catastrophic incident? How quickly? How easily? How long would you have to shut down your or your clients’ operations to recover from data theft or loss?

If you’re not absolutely sure of the answers to those questions, use the move to Windows 11 as an opportunity to do what you need to do ensure that your data is not just backed up but available — no matter what.

## It’s so hard to say goodbye to Windows 10

Migration to Windows 11 doesn’t have to be difficult. There are [methods that can speed the process](https://www.acronis.com/en/blog/posts/10-steps-to-windows-11-a-modern-migration-with-acronis-cyber-protect/?utm%5Fsource=bleepingcomputer&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=bleepingcomputer-fy25-q4-mixed-amer-nam-en-ba-q4brandq4truba-x-bleepingcomputer-a) and build in a cybersecurity check at the same time. Users of a certain age will remember adjusting to the “ribbon” in Microsoft Office, which was once hated but is now standard.

What is at first startling eventually becomes normal. That’s the story of Windows and, frankly, of technology in general.

Windows 11 will require some adjustment, but it’s no Vista. It’s more established than Vista ever was. It works better. It has solid market share among Windows operating systems that’s likely to grow, and it has more users than Windows 10\. (The Windows 7 boom won’t likely last, either.) Besides, moving to Windows 11 is the safe move. Use it as an opportunity to make your environment safer.
