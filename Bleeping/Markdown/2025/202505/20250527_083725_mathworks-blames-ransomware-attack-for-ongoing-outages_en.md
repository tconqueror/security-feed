MathWorks, a leading developer of mathematical computing and simulation software, has revealed that a recent ransomware attack is behind an ongoing service outage.

Headquartered in Natick, Massachusetts, and founded in 1984, MathWorks now has over 6,500 employees in 34 offices worldwide. MathWorks develops the MATLAB numeric computing platform and the Simulink simulation, which are used by over 100,000 organizations and over 5 million customers.

"MathWorks experienced a ransomware attack. We have notified federal law enforcement of this matter. The attack affected our IT systems," the company [disclosed](https://status.mathworks.com/incidents/h1fjvcr72n87) in an incident report published on its official status page.

"Some of our online applications used by customers became unavailable, and certain internal systems used by staff became unavailable, beginning on Sunday, May 18."

While ongoing outages resulting from this incident still affect many of its online services, including the cloud center, file exchange, license center, and MathWorks store, the company has since brought some back online.

For instance, after multiple days of signing issues preventing users from accessing their accounts, MathWorks restored multi-factor authentication (MFA) and account SSO (Single Sign On) on May 21st.

Despite this, since Friday, some customers have continued experiencing issues preventing them from creating new accounts, while others who haven't signed in since 11 October 2024 haven't been able to log in at all.

MathWorks has yet to reveal additional information regarding this incident, including the name of the ransomware operation behind the attack and whether any customer data was stolen during the breach.

Even though the company tagged this incident as a ransomware attack, no ransomware gang has claimed the breach, suggesting that MathWorks has either paid the ransom demanded by the attackers or is still negotiating.

A MathWorks spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer.
