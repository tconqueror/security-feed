The Play ransomware gang has exploited a high-severity Windows Common Log File System flaw in zero-day attacks to gain SYSTEM privileges and deploy malware on compromised systems.

The vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-29824](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-29824), was tagged by Microsoft as exploited in a limited number of attacks and patched during [last month's Patch Tuesday](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-april-2025-patch-tuesday-fixes-exploited-zero-day-134-flaws/).

"The targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia," [Microsoft said in April](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-windows-clfs-zero-day-exploited-by-ransomware-gang/).

Microsoft linked these attacks to the RansomEXX ransomware gang, saying the attackers installed the PipeMagic backdoor malware, which was used to drop the CVE-2025-29824 exploit, deploy ransomware payloads, and ransom notes after encrypting files.

Since then, Symantec's Threat Hunter Team has also found evidence linking them to the Play ransomware-as-a-service operation, saying the attackers deployed a CVE-2025-29824 zero-day privilege escalation exploit after breaching a U.S. organization's network.

"Although no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion, the attackers deployed the Grixba infostealer, which is a custom tool associated with Balloonfly, the attackers behind the Play ransomware operation," [Symantec said](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/play-ransomware-zero-day).

"Balloonfly is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least June 2022 and uses the Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) in attacks."

The Grixba custom network-scanning and information-stealing tool [was first spotted two years ago](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/play-ransomware-gang-uses-custom-shadow-volume-copy-data-theft-tool/), and Play ransomware operators typically use it to enumerate users and computers in compromised networks.

The Play cybercrime gang surfaced in June 2022 and is also known for double-extortion attacks, in which its affiliates pressure victims into paying ransoms to avoid having their stolen data leaked online.

In December 2023, the FBI [issued a joint advisory](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-play-ransomware-breached-300-victims-including-critical-orgs/) with CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), warning that the Play ransomware gang had breached the networks of around 300 organizations worldwide as of October 2023.
