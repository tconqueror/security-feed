Microsoft has announced that it will discontinue the password storage and autofill feature in the Authenticator app starting in July and will complete the deprecation in August 2025.

The decision is to streamline autofill support and consolidate credentials management under a single platform, Microsoft Edge.

The move requires action from impacted users as they are given until August 1, 2025, to export their information from Authenticator, or risk losing it.

Microsoft Authenticator is a free mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en)) that provides secure sign-in for mobile accounts using multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods like time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), push notifications, or biometrics-based confirmations.

The app supports authentication for Microsoft services like Microsoft accounts, Azure AD, and GitHub, as well as non-Microsoft platforms.

The autofill feature was added to mobile Authenticator apps [in December 2020,](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-authenticator-brings-password-autofill-to-mobile-devices/) allowing users to fill their credentials saved in the Authenticator on sign-in forms automatically.

Support for this feature is about to end, though, as Microsoft announced the phased deprecation of autofill in three steps:

* **June 2025**: You can no longer save new passwords in Authenticator.
* **July 2025**: Autofill will stop working in Authenticator; stored payment info will be deleted.
* **August 2025**: Saved passwords and unsaved generated passwords will no longer be accessible in Authenticator.

## Users pushed to (the) Edge

Microsoft announced that autofill and the password manager are now moving to its browser, Edge.

Users who want to continue using the passwords saved in Microsoft Authenticator for autofill will need to install Microsoft Edge on their phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-edge-ai-browser/id1288723196), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx)).

"Your saved passwords (but not your generated password history) and addresses are securely synced to your Microsoft account, and you can continue to access them and enjoy seamless autofill functionality with Microsoft Edge," [reads the announcement](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/changes-to-microsoft-authenticator-autofill-09fd75df-dc04-4477-9619-811510805ab6).

To complete the migration of the autofill functionality to Microsoft's browser, users need to find 'Autofill/Passwords' in their device settings and choose Edge as the preferred service.

Then, launch Edge and sign in with your Microsoft account to allow the syncing of passwords to begin.

If everything is done correctly, all passwords should be accessible via Settings > Passwords on Edge.

If users don't want to use Edge, Microsoft allows exporting passwords so they can be moved to another password manager, but this must be done before August 1, 2025. For payment information, July 2025 is the deadline.

To [export passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/account-billing/export-passwords-from-microsoft-authenticator-10268a16-c0a4-4037-9bcb-b47c29409fe0) from Microsoft Authenticator, select menu > Settings > Autofill > Export Passwords > select an export location and tap 'Save.'

The importing process is only applicable to account passwords. Payment info will have to be manually re-inputted for security reasons.

Microsoft noted that Passkeys will continue to be supported in Authenticator, so users who actively use them to sign in to their Microsoft Accounts must ensure the app remains enabled as their Passkey Provider.
