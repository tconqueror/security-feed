During the second day of Pwn2Own Berlin 2025, competitors earned $435,000 after exploiting zero-day bugs in multiple products, including Microsoft SharePoint, VMware ESXi, Oracle VirtualBox, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Mozilla Firefox.

The highlight was a successful attempt from Nguyen Hoang Thach of STARLabs SG against the VMware ESXi, which earned him $150,000 for an integer overflow exploit.

Dinh Ho Anh Khoa of Viettel Cyber Security was awarded $100,000 for hacking Microsoft SharePoint by leveraging an exploit chain combining an auth bypass and an insecure deserialization flaw.

Palo Alto Networks' Edouard Bochin and Tao Yan also demoed an out-of-bounds write zero-day in Mozilla Firefox, while Gerrard Tai of STAR Labs SG escalated privileges to root on Red Hat Enterprise Linux using a use-after-free bug, and Viettel Cyber Security used another out-of-bounds write for an Oracle VirtualBox guest-to-host escape.

In the AI category, Wiz Research security researchers used a use-after-free zero-day to exploit Redis and Qrious Secure chained four security flaws to hack Nvidia's Triton Inference Server.

[On the first day](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-11-and-red-hat-linux-virtualbox-hacked-on-first-day-of-pwn2own/), competitors were awarded $260,000 after successfully exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows 11, Red Hat Linux, and Oracle VirtualBox, reaching a total of $695,000 earned over the first two days of the contest after demonstrating 20 unique 0-days.

​​​The [Pwn2Own Berlin 2025](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2025/2/24/announcing-pwn2own-berlin-2025) hacking competition focuses on enterprise technologies, introduces an AI category for the first time, and takes place during the [OffensiveCon](https://www.offensivecon.org/) conference between May 15 and May 17.

Security researchers will be able to earn over $1,000,000 in rewards for demonstrating zero-day bugs in fully patched products in the AI, web browser, virtualization, local privilege escalation, servers, enterprise applications, cloud-native/container, and automotive categories.

However, no Tesla attempts were registered before Pwn2Own started, even though two 2025 Tesla Model Y and 2024 Tesla Model 3 bench-top units were also available as targets.

On the [last day of the contest](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2025/5/14/pwn2own-berlin-the-full-schedule#day3), the hackers will attempt to exploit zero-day bugs in Windows 11, Oracle VirtualBox, VMware ESXi, VMware Workstation, Mozilla Firefox, as well as Nvidia's Triton Inference Server and Container Toolkit.

After zero-day exploits are disclosed during the Pwn2Own contest, vendors have 90 days to release security fixes for their software and hardware products before Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative publishes technical details.
