SonicWall has released a firmware update that can help customers remove rootkit malware deployed in attacks targeting SMA 100 series devices.

"SonicWall SMA 100 10.2.2.2-92sv build has been released with additional file checking, providing the capability to remove known rootkit malware present on the SMA devices," the company said in a [Monday advisory](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2025-0015).

"SonicWall strongly recommends that users of the SMA 100 series products (SMA 210, 410, and 500v) upgrade to the 10.2.2.2-92sv version."

The update follows a July report from researchers at the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), who observed a threat actor tracked as UNC6148 [deploying OVERSTEP malware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-sma-devices-hacked-with-overstep-rootkit-tied-to-ransomware/) on end-of-life (EoL) SonicWall SMA 100 devices that will reach end-of-support next week, on October 1, 2025.

OVERSTEP is a user-mode rootkit that enables attackers to maintain persistent access by using hidden malicious components and establishing a reverse shell on compromised devices. The malware steals sensitive files, including the persist_._database and certificate files, providing hackers with access to credentials, OTP seeds, and certificates that further enable persistence.

While the researchers have not determined the goal behind UNC6148's attacks, they did find "noteworthy overlaps" with Abyss-related ransomware incidents.

For instance, in late 2023, Truesec [investigated an Abyss ransomware incident](https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/web-shell-on-a-sonicwall-sma) in which hackers installed a web shell on an SMA appliance, enabling them to maintain persistence despite firmware updates. In March 2024, InfoGuard AG incident responder Stephan Berger reported a similar SMA device compromise that also resulted in the deployment of Abyss malware.

"The threat intelligence report from Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) highlights potential risk of using older versions of SMA100 firmware," SonicWall added on Monday, urging admins to implement the security measures outlined in [this July advisory](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/urgent-advisory-for-addressing-rootkits-and-other-critical-vulnerabilities-in-sonicwall-sma-100-series-appliances/250730071322160).

Last week, SonicWall [warned customers to reset credentials](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-customers-to-reset-credentials-after-MySonicWall-breach/) after their firewall configuration backup files were exposed in brute-force attacks targeting the API service for cloud backup.

In August, the company also [dismissed claims](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-finds-no-sslvpn-zero-day-links-ransomware-attacks-to-2024-flaw/) that the Akira ransomware gang was hacking Gen 7 firewalls using [a potential zero-day exploit](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/surge-of-akira-ransomware-attacks-hits-sonicwall-firewall-devices/), clarifying that the issue was tied to a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-40766) that was patched in November 2024.

The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) and cybersecurity firm Rapid7 later confirmed that the Akira gang is [exploiting this vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/akira-ransomware-exploiting-critical-sonicwall-sslvpn-bug-again/) to target unpatched SonicWall devices.
