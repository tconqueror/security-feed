![Android](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/02/08/Android.jpg)

Google has released the September 2025 security update for Android devices, addressing a total of **84** vulnerabilities, including two that were *actively exploited* in zero‑day attacks.

## Actively Exploited Flaws

| CVE | Component | Summary |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| **CVE-2025-38352** | Android kernel | Elevation of privilege via a race condition in POSIX CPU timers. First disclosed on July 22, 2025 and fixed in kernel versions 6.12.35‑1 and later. |
| **CVE-2025-48543** | Android Runtime (ART) | Elevation of privilege that allows a malicious app to bypass sandbox restrictions and access higher‑level system capabilities. |

Google’s bulletin noted that *those two flaws may be under limited, targeted exploitation*, but released no further details.

## Critical‑Severity Issues

In addition to the two actively exploited flaws, the update mitigates **four** critical‑severity problems:

- **CVE-2025-48539** – Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Android’s System component.  
  An attacker within physical or network proximity (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi‑Fi range) can execute arbitrary code on the device without any user interaction or privileges.

- **CVE-2025-21450** – (Critical) – Qualcomm component (details below).

- **CVE-2025-21483** – (Critical) – Qualcomm component (details below).

- **CVE-2025-27034** – (Critical) – Qualcomm component (details below).

### Qualcomm‑Specific Vulnerabilities

According to Qualcomm’s own bulletin:

| CVE | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **CVE-2025-21483** | Memory corruption in the data‑network stack during reassembly of video (NALUs) from RTP packets. Attackers can send crafted network traffic to trigger out‑of‑bounds writes, enabling remote code execution without user interaction. |
| **CVE-2025-27034** | Array‑index validation bug in the mult‑mode call processor during PLMN selection from the SOR failed list. Malformed network responses can corrupt memory and enable code execution in the modem baseband. |
| **CVE-2025-21450** | (Further details omitted for brevity – see Qualcomm bulletin). |

The Android patch incorporates fixes for **27** Qualcomm components, raising the total number of fixed flaws to **111**. These fixes do not affect devices built on other manufacturers’ chips.

### MediaTek‑Powered Devices

Detailed security fixes for MediaTek‑based devices are available on the vendor’s bulletin:  
<https://corp.mediatek.com/product-security-bulletin/September-2025>.

## Coverage

The update addresses vulnerabilities in **Android 13 through Android 16**; not all flaws affect every OS version.

## Recommended Action

Upgrade to the September 2025 security‑patch level:

```text
Settings > System > Software updates > System update
```

Then click **“Check for update.”**  

If you’re running **Android 12 or earlier**, consider upgrading to a newer, actively supported model or installing a third‑party Android distribution that incorporates the latest security updates.
