A 17-year-old hacker who surrendered to face charges over cyberattacks targeting Vegas casinos in 2023 has been released into the custody of his parents, a family court judge ruled.

The teenage boy, who is suspected to be part of the Scattered Spier threat group, has been imposed some restrictions that include limited use of the internet, phone, and electronics.

Although the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department did not name the casinos targeted, it noted that the attacks occurred between August and October 2023 and described them as "sophisticated network intrusions" attributed to Scattered Spider.

During that period, Scattered Spider compromised the network of MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment casinos. and deployed the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware.

The incidents caused significant [operational disruptions](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mgm-resorts-shuts-down-it-systems-after-cyberattack/) and compromised sensitive data belonging to staff and customers. They cost MGM more than [$100 million in damages](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mgm-resorts-ransomware-attack-led-to-100-million-loss-data-theft/), while [Caesars paid a $15 million ransom](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/caesars-entertainment-confirms-ransom-payment-customer-data-theft/).

The prosecutors believe the suspect is still holding an estimated $1.8 million worth of Bitcoin cryptocurrency but it hasn't been found yet. They argued that the suspect should remain detained until the hearing in November, on grounds of his operational sophistication and massive financial gain.

The hacker’s lawyers characterized the detention request as “disingenuous,” highlighting the teen’s clean criminal recor and requesting a supervised release.

Family Court Judge Dee Smart Butler [sided with the defense](https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/judge-orders-release-of-teen-accused-in-2023-casino-cyber-attacks-3465089/) and ordered the release subject to the following restrictions:

* Live with parents on a registered address
* Cannot leave Clark County, Nevada
* Internet access strictly limited to educational purposes
* Restriction on the use of phones and electronics

Any violation of the above will result in the immediate detention by probation officers.

The charges the hacker [currently faces](https://www.lvmpd.com/Home/Components/News/News/2245/263) concern obtaining personally identifiable information for harm or impersonation, extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, and unlawful computer acts.

The prosecutors are seeking additional charges and also request that the hacker be tried as an adult, which incurs harsher, long-term imprisonment sentences.

Last year, another teenage boy, a 17-year old, was [arrested](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-arrests-suspected-scattered-spider-hacker-linked-to-mgm-attack/) in connection with Scattered Spider cyberattacks. He was released on bail pending investigation.

The boy was suspected of being involved in the MGM Resorts ransomware attack and part of the Scattered Spider hacking collective.
