The Co-operative Group in the U.K. released its interim financial results report for the first half of 2025 with a massive loss in operating profit of £80 million ($107 million) due to the cyberattack it suffered last April.

The impact is analyzed into two categories, namely £20 million in one-off incremental costs and £60 million from lost sales while systems were offline.

The cybersecurity incident also caused a reduction in revenue of £206 million ($277 million). Co-op states that it expects another £20 million in losses for the second half of the year, as recovery will continue.

Co-op is a large UK member-owned co-operative group active in food retail, life services, and business-to-business services. It operates 2,300 food retail stores and 59 franchise stores.

In late April 2025, the group [shut down parts of its IT systems](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-retailer-co-op-shuts-down-some-it-systems-after-hack-attempt/) after detecting hacking attacks, causing limited disruption to back-office and call-center services.

A couple of days later, Co-op confirmed that it had been targeted by hackers linked to the [DragonForce ransomware](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/co-op-confirms-data-theft-after-dragonforce-ransomware-claims-attack/) operation, who managed to steal personal data of a large number of current and past members, including names and contact details.

The attack, attributed to Scattered Spider affiliates, forced Co-op to rebuild its Windows domain controllers and further extend system unavailability.

On July 10th, U.K.’s National Crime Agency [arrested four young suspects](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/four-arrested-in-uk-over-mands-co-op-harrods-cyberattacks/) (ages 17–20) linked to the Co-op cyberattack, as well as those at [Marks & Spencer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marks-and-spencer-confirms-a-cyberattack-as-customers-face-delayed-orders/) and [Harrods](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harrods-the-next-uk-retailer-targeted-in-a-cyberattack/) that occurred around the same period.

On July 16th, Co-op published new details on its internal investigation, informing that hackers stole the personal data of all [6.5 million members](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/co-op-confirms-data-of-65-million-members-stolen-in-cyberattack/) during the April cyberattack.

Although Co-op’s response to the attack was prompt and prevented the attempted encryption, the group suffered a significant financial impact.

Manual processes were introduced temporarily, 350,000 items were rerouted to support independent co-ops and franchise partners, and discount coupons were offered to members.

Still, the group continued to face limited volume problems, experienced severe stock allocation issues, and a collapse in sales for some categories, such as tobacco.

Despite the disruption and the expected ongoing effects, liquidity remained strong, with £800 million being available to "navigate external pressures while maintaining focus on long-term ambitions."

The CFO underlined that no funding concerns arose from the cyber-incident.
