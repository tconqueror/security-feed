WhatsApp has started rolling out a new translation feature that enables Android and iPhone users to translate messages in chats, groups, and channel updates.

While iOS users can only use it to translate manually after tapping 'Translate,' Android users will also be able to enable automatic translation, allowing all messages in a chat thread to be translated without having to tap each one individually.

"We're rolling out message translations to Android and iPhone users gradually from today, in a few select languages to start with more to follow," the company [said](https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-message-translations) on Tuesday.

"If you see a message in a different language, you can now simply long-press and tap 'Translate'. Choose the language you want the message to be translated from or to, and download it to be saved for future translations."

The new feature supports over 19 languages on iOS devices, while Android users will be able to translate text in English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic.

WhatsApp added that the feature is also designed to protect the users' privacy, as it will translate all content on the device without sending it to the company's servers.

"Message translations were designed to protect the privacy of your chats. That's why translations occur on your device where WhatsApp cannot see them," it added.

In April, WhatsApp [introduced a new Advanced Chat Privacy feature](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapps-new-advanced-chat-privacy-protects-sensitive-messages/) that protects sensitive information exchanged in group conversations and private chats.

Last month, the messaging service also [unveiled a new security feature](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapp-adds-new-security-feature-to-protect-against-scams/) that helps users spot potential scams when they are added to a new group chat by someone not in their contact list.

Meta says that more than three billion people from over 180 countries are using WhatsApp's instant messaging and video calling platform.
