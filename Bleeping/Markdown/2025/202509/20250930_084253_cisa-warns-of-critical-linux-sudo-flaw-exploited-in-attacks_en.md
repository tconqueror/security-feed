Hackers are actively exploiting a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-32463) in the _sudo_ package that enables the execution of commands with root-level privileges on Linux operating systems.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has added this vulnerability to its [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog#:~:text=SUDO%20%7C%20SUDO-,CVE%2D2025%2D32463,-Sudo%20Inclusion%20of) (KEV) catalog, describing it as “an inclusion of functionality from untrusted control sphere.”

CISA has given federal agencies until October 20 to apply the official mitigations or discontinue the use of _sudo_.

A local attacker can exploit this flaw to escalate privileges by using the -R (--chroot) option, even if they are not included in the _sudoers_ list, a configuration file that specifies which users or groups are authorized to execute commands with elevated permissions.

_Sudo_ (“superuser do”) allows system administrators to delegate their authority to certain unprivileged users while logging the executed commands and their arguments.

Officially disclosed on June 30, CVE-2025-32463 affects _sudo_ versions 1.9.14 through 1.9.17 and has received a critical severity score of 9.3 out of 10.

“An attacker can leverage sudo’s -R (--chroot) option to run arbitrary commands as root, even if they are not listed in the sudoers file,” explains the [security advisory](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/).

[Rich Mirch](https://twitter.com/0xm1rch), a researcher at cybersecurity services company Stratascale who discovered CVE-2025-32463, [noted](https://blog.mirch.io/sudo-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerabilities/#cve-2025-32463---sudo-chroot-elevation-of-privilege-vulnerability) that the issue impacts the default _sudo_ configuration and can be exploited without any predefined rules for the user.

On July 4, Mirch released a [proof-of-concept exploit](https://github.com/mirchr/CVE-2025-32463-sudo-chwoot/blob/main/sudo-chwoot.sh) for the CVE-2025-32463 flaw, which has existed since June 2023 with the release of version 1.9.14.

However, additional exploits have circulated publicly since July 1, likely derived from the [technical write-up](https://www.stratascale.com/vulnerability-alert-CVE-2025-32463-sudo-chroot).

CISA has warned that the CVE-2025-32463 vulnerability in _sudo_ is being exploited in real-world attacks, although the agency has not specified the types of incidents in which it has been leveraged.

Organizations worldwide are advised to use CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog as a reference for prioritizing patching and implementing other security mitigations.
