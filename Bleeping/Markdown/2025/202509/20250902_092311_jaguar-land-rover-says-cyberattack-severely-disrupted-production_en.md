Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) announced that a cyberattack forced the company to shut down certain systems as part of the mitigation effort.

Although the incident appears to have a significant impact on the automakers’ production and retail operations, the short statement published on the official website noted that customer data is most likely unaffected.

“JLR has been impacted by a cyber incident. We took immediate action to mitigate its impact by proactively shutting down our systems,” [reads the statement](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2025/09/statement-cyber-incident).

“At this stage there is no evidence any customer data has been stolen but our retail and production activities have been severely disrupted,” the company says.

JLR also stated that it is "now working at pace to restart our global applications in a controlled manner."

Jaguar Land Rover operate as a single company, JLR, under Tata Motors India, after being both acquired from Ford in 2008.

With an annuall revenue of more than $38 billion (£29 billion), the company produces more than 400,000 vehicles every year and employs 39,000 people.

The first reports about a severe disruption at JLR operations came from dealers in the UK that were [unable to register new cars](http://Palo%20Alto%20Networks%20data%20breach%20exposes%20customer%20and%20support%20info) or supply parts at service points.

Responding to media queries, JLR stated that an attack had occurred over the weekend, which forced it to shut down several systems, including those used at the [Solihull production plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solihull%5Fplant).

This is where popular models like the Land Rover Discovery, Range Rover, and Range Rover Sport are built.

The company has not provided a timeline for returning to normal operational status and did not provide any details about the type of attack it is dealing with.

Attacks over the weekend are common as threat actors know that it's time when companies are less capable to respond efficiently and stop the breach before it's too late.

At the time of writing this, no ransomware gangs have taken responsibility for an attack at JLR.

BleepingComputer has contacted the automaker to ask more information about the type of incident and potential impact on customers, and we will update this post with their statement once it reaches us.
