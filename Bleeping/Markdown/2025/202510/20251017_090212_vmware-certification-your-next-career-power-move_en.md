Every IT pro remembers the first time they built something that just worked. A perfectly tuned lab, clean deployment, the moment everything clicked. VMware certification gives you that feeling again and again.

It’s a framework for mastering complex systems, proving your expertise, and building the confidence to design and defend infrastructure that lasts. And, when you combine that power with VMUG Advantage, you get a direct line to hands-on practice, expert mentorship, and real savings on your VMware journey.

As VMUG President Brenda Emerson put it, “VMware certifications aren’t about memorizing trivia—they’re about proving capability, clarity, and consistency.”

Certified teams don’t guess their way through workloads or network plans; they execute with confidence.

Tamecka McKay, a VMUG Board Director, said it even more directly: “When your team is trained and confident in VMware’s platforms, you’re prepared to build secure, trusted infrastructure. Certification creates that confidence and competence.”

Across our community, from Brenda to Tamecka, one message keeps coming through:

**Certification doesn’t just change your skills. It changes your career.**

## The Proof Is in the Progress

And survey data backs it up. According to [Pearson VUE's 2025 Value of IT Certification Candidate Report](https://www.cio.com/article/3976800/the-rising-value-of-it-certifications.html), 63% of surveyed professionals received a job promotion or were anticipating one after becoming certified. And 82% reported more confidence in pursuing new job opportunities!

Why? Because certified professionals build more secure, scalable, and consistent environments.

And when entire teams are certified together, as Brenda shared, “Innovation doesn’t get stalled at the handoff. It builds empowered teams.”

That empowerment creates a culture where certified teams move faster, communicate better, and retain talent longer.

## From Lab to Leadership

VMUG Vice President Matt Heldstab described the moment he passed his first certification exam as the moment everything clicked. "\[Certification\] didn’t just validate what I already knew, it gave me a framework to understand what I didn’t yet know — and the confidence to bridge that gap.”

When you feel in the dark in your work, certification is like a mirror to help you peek around the corner. It prepares you to design better, troubleshoot smarter, and lead stronger.

As Matt put it, “Certification isn’t just about checking a box. It shapes your mindset. It moves you from short-term fixes to long-term architecture and transforms you from a reactive operator into a proactive strategist.”
