_Correction: After publishing, Red Hat confirmed that it was a GitLab account breach, not GitHub._

An extortion group calling itself the Crimson Collective claims to have breached Red Hat's private GitLab repositories, stealing nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal projects.

This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network and platforms.

A CER is a consulting document prepared for clients that often contains infrastructure details, configuration data, authentication tokens, and other information that could be abused to breach customer networks.

Red Hat confirmed that it suffered a security incident related to its consulting business, but would not verify any of the attacker's claims regarding the stolen GitLab repositories and customer CERs.

"Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps," Red Hat told BleepingComputer.

"The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority. At this time, we have no reason to believe the security issue impacts any of our other Red Hat services or products and are highly confident in the integrity of our software supply chain."

While Red Hat did not respond to any further questions about the breach, the hackers told BleepingComputer that the intrusion occurred approximately two weeks ago.

They allegedly found authentication tokens, full database URIs, and other private information in Red Hat code and CERs, which they claimed to use to gain access to downstream customer infrastructure.

The hacking group also published a complete directory listing of the allegedly stolen GitLab repositories and a list of CERs from 2020 through 2025 on Telegram.

The directory listing of CERs include a wide range of sectors and well known organizations such as Bank of America, T-Mobile, AT&T, Fidelity, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Walmart, Costco, the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Federal Aviation Administration, the House of Representatives, and many others.

The hackers stated that they attempted to contact Red Hat with an extortion demand but received no response other than a templated reply instructing them to submit a vulnerability report to their security team.

According to them, the created ticket was repeatedly assigned to additional people, including Red Hat's legal and security staff members.

BleepingComputer sent Red Hat additional questions, and we will update this story if we receive more information.

The same group also claimed responsibility for briefly [defacing Nintendo’s topic page](http://x.com/pirat%5Fnation/status/1970821013559538141) last week to include contact information and links to their Telegram channel
