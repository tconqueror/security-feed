WhatsApp is rolling out passkey-encrypted backups for iOS and Android devices, enabling users to encrypt their chat history using their fingerprint, face, or a screen lock code.

Passkeys are a passwordless authentication method that allows users to sign in using biometrics (such as face recognition or fingerprint), PINs, or security patterns instead of traditional passwords. They enable logging into websites, online services, or apps without needing to remember complex passwords or use a password manager.

When creating a passkey, your device generates a unique cryptographic key pair consisting of a private key stored on the device and a public key sent to the website or app. Because of this, passkeys provide significantly improved security over regular credentials, seeing that they can't be stolen in data breaches because the private key never leaves your device.

"Passkeys will allow you to use your fingerprint, face, or screen lock code to encrypt your chat backups instead of having to memorize a password or a cumbersome 64-digit encryption key," WhatsApp said.

"Now, with just a tap or a glance, the same security that protects your personal chats and calls on WhatsApp is applied to your chat backups so they are always safe, accessible and private."

To get started, enable the security feature by navigating to WhatsApp settings, then selecting Chats > Chat backup > End-to-end encrypted backup.

Meta has started introducing this feature worldwide, with the rollout expected to reach all users gradually over the coming weeks and months.

â€‹WhatsApp [introduced end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) chat backups](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapp-rolls-out-ios-android-end-to-end-encrypted-chat-backups/) on iOS and Android four years ago, in October 2021, enabling iOS users to store their backups on iCloud and Android users to store them on Google Drive.

Once enabled, E2EE chat backups allow WhatsApp users to restore their messages on any device if they have the password or passkey used to encrypt them.
