​HackerOne noted that the number of AI vulnerabilities has increased by more than 200%, with prompt injection vulnerabilities surging by a staggering 540%, confirming them as the quickest-growing threat in AI security.

At the same time, security issues such as XSS (cross-site scripting) and SQLi (SQL injection) are in decline, while authorization flaws, including improper access control and IDOR (insecure direct object reference), are experiencing a significant increase in reports.

In total, 1,121 bug bounty programs on HackerOne included AI in scope in 2025, a 270% increase YoY, with autonomous AI-powered agents submitting 560+ valid reports.

The company added that 70% of over 1,820 researchers surveyed over the last year have used AI tools in their workflow "to enhance their hunting abilities."

"AI vulnerabilities increased by more than 200% this year, while enterprises expanded AI security initiatives at nearly three times last year's pace," [said HackerOne CEO Kara Sprague](https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/hackerone-report-finds-210-spike-ai-vulnerability-reports-amid-rise-ai-autonomy).

"At the same time, a new generation of 'bionic hackers'—security researchers using AI to enhance their hunting abilities—are driving the discovery of security issues at unprecedented scale."
