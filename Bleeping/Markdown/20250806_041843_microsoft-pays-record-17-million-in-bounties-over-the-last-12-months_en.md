Microsoft paid a record $17 million this year to 344 security researchers across 59 countries through its bug bounty program.

Between July 2024 and June 2025, the researchers submitted a total of 1,469 eligible vulnerability reports, with the highest individual bounty reaching $200,000.

These reports helped resolve more than 1,000 potential security vulnerabilities across various Microsoft products and platforms, including Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, Windows, Edge, and Xbox.

"By incentivizing independent researchers to identify vulnerabilities in high-impact areas, including the rapidly evolving field of AI, we're able to stay ahead of emerging threats," Microsoft [stated](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/08/microsoft-bounty-program-year-in-review-17-million-in-rewards/) in its annual bounty program review.

"Through Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, these researchers play a critical role in reinforcing the trust that millions of users place in Microsoft technologies every day."

During the previous year, Microsoft [paid another $16.6 million](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/08/microsoft-bounty-program-year-in-review-16.6m-in-rewards/) in bounty awards to 343 security researchers from 55 countries.

## Bug bounty program updates

The company has also expanded several bounty programs this year, such as Copilot AI, Defender products, and various identity management systems.

For instance, the Copilot bounty program now includes traditional online service vulnerabilities, the Dynamics 365 and Power Platform programs introduced a new AI category, and the Windows program has added awards for remote denial-of-service attacks and local sandbox escape scenarios.

Additionally, the Identity bounty program now covers more APIs and domains, and the Defender program has added Microsoft Defender for Identity (MDI), Microsoft Defender for Office (MDO), and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Applications (MDA).
