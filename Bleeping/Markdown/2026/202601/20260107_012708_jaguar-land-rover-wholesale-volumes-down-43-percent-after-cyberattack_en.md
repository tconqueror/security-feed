Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) revealed this week that a September 2025 cyberattack led to a 43% decline in third-quarter wholesale volumes.

This significant decline in sales is due to production issues following the attack and subsequent delays in distributing vehicles globally after manufacturing resumed. Production returned to normal levels only by mid-November after a phased approach, further limiting its ability to fulfill orders.

The automaker said that sales were also impacted by U.S. tariffs and the planned discontinuation of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the brand's relaunch.

"Due to this and also the time required to distribute vehicles globally once produced, wholesale and retail volumes reduced on a quarter‑on‑quarter and year‑on‑year basis," JLR said in a [Monday press release](https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2026/01/jlr-q3-sales-impacted-cyber-incident-previously-indicated).

"Wholesale volumes for the third quarter were 59,200 units (excluding the Chery Jaguar Land Rover China JV ('CJLR')), down 43.3% year‑on‑year and down 10.6% compared to Q2 FY26."

JLR sales declined in all major markets compared to last year, with North America experiencing a 64% drop in wholesale volumes, Europe a 48% decline, China a 46% hit, and the U.K. market decreasing by only 0.9%.

The company also revealed in financial results published in November that the [cost of the cyberattack totaled £196 million](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-cyberattack-cost-the-company-over-220-million/) ($220 million) in the quarter. The same week, the Bank of England [said the country's GDP was weaker than expected](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2025/november-2025) in Q3 2025, flagging the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack as one of the key reasons.

The British luxury automaker owned by Tata Motors plans to release its full third-quarter financial results in February 2026.

The [September 2nd cyberattack](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-says-cyberattack-severely-disrupted-production/) forced the carmaker to send staff home and shut down production. In a follow-up statement, it also confirmed that [data had been stolen](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-jlr-confirms-data-theft-after-recent-cyberattack/) during the cyberattack, which was later claimed by the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters cybercrime collective made out of cybercriminals from the Lapsus$, Scattered Spider, and ShinyHunters extortion groups.

This incident [disrupted JLR's operations for multiple weeks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/jaguar-land-rover-extends-shutdown-after-cyberattack-by-another-week/), impacting its financial and market position and increasing risks for the company and some of its suppliers, which faced severe liquidity issues.

On September 29, the [U.K. government intervened](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/uk-govt-backs-jlr-with-15-billion-loan-guarantee-after-cyberattack/), approving a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to help JLR restore its supply chain and restart production.

JLR employs over 39,000 people, has annual revenues of over $38 billion (£29 billion), and makes more than 400,000 vehicles each year.
