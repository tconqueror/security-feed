A Sedgwick spokesperson told BleepingComputer that the company is currently investigating a security breach that impacted its subsidiary, adding that the parent company's network was not affected.

Sedgwick has also notified law enforcement and has hired outside cybersecurity experts to investigate the impact of the breach.

"Sedgwick is addressing a security incident at one of its subsidiaries, Sedgwick Government Solutions. Following the detection of the incident, we initiated our incident response protocols and engaged external cybersecurity experts through outside counsel to assist with our investigation of the affected isolated file transfer system," the spokesperson said.

"Importantly, Sedgwick Government Solutions is segmented from the rest of our business, and no wider Sedgwick systems or data were affected. Further, there is no evidence of access to claims management servers nor any impact on Sedgwick Government Solutions ability to continue serving its clients. We have notified law enforcement and remain in contact with our clients as we conduct our investigation."

While the company didn't attribute the attack to a specific threat group, the statement confirms the TridentLocker ransomware group's claims that they breached the company.

The threat actors say they've stolen 3.39 GB of documents and, since taking responsibility for the attack, they've also published some of the allegedly stolen data on their Tor data leak website.
