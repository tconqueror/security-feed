Microsoft plans to introduce a call reporting feature in Teams by mid-March, allowing users to flag suspicious or unwanted calls as potential scams or phishing attempts.

The new "Report a Call" function will be enabled by default, but administrators who want to disable the new security feature can toggle off "Report a Call" in the Teams Admin Center under "Calling settings."

The feature will be available in Teams call history for one-to-one calls on Windows, Mac, and web, and it will let users click "More options" next to any call and select "Report a Call" to submit a report.

As Microsoft explained, when users flag a call, limited metadata (including timestamps, duration, caller ID information, and participant Teams IDs) will be shared with the organization and Microsoft.

"Currently, users have no simple way to report suspicious calls, leaving organizations without visibility into these threats and without clear guidance on how users should respond," Microsoft said in a [message center update](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/MessageCenter/:/messages/MC1223828).

"Reports share limited call metadata with organizations and Microsoft, viewable in Microsoft Defender portal or Teams Admin Center. The feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by admins."

The feature will roll out to Targeted Release customers in mid-March, with completion expected by late March, and it will reach general availability worldwide by late April.

Security teams with Defender for Office 365 (Plan 1 or Plan 2) or Defender XDR licenses can view detailed reported instances in the Microsoft Defender portal, while organizations without Defender licenses will be able to access basic submission data in Teams Admin Center under Protection Reports.

In November, Microsoft also rolled out a new Teams security feature that allows users to [report false-positive threat alerts](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-teams-to-let-users-report-messages-wrongly-flagged-as-threats/) triggered by messages incorrectly flagged as malicious.

More recently, it announced that admins can now block external users via the Defender portal, an option designed to thwart [cybercrime gangs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-voice-calls-abused-to-push-matanbuchus-malware/) (including [ransomware groups](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-basta-ransomware-poses-as-it-support-on-microsoft-teams-to-breach-networks/)) attempts to abuse Teams in social engineering attacks targeting victims' employees.

The company also announced new fraud protection features for Teams calls that will start rolling out in mid-February, warning users about external callers who attempt to impersonate trusted organizations in social engineering attacks.
