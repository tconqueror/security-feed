The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.

WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”

WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.

According to [Russian media](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/02/2026/698d78079a7947ffe922a0e8), the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains _whatsapp.com_ and _web.whatsapp.com_ from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.

In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.

However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been [designated as an “extremist” entity](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63218095) in Russia since 2022.

WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began [throttling voice and video calls](https://tass.com/economy/2001779). In October 2025, the authorities attempted to [block new user registrations](https://kod.ru/telegram-i-whatsapp-bez-sms).

Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov [reportedly stated that](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/02/2026/698d07dc9a794741239bc1fb) the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.

WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was [reportedly aggressively throttled](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/02/russia-slowing-down-of-telegram-messaging-app-another-blow-for-freedom-of-expression/) earlier this week in Russia.

Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.

MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which [became mandatory](https://t.me/government%5Frus/23209) on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.

Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have [raised concerns](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-app-max-data-privacy-concerns-whatsapp-kremlin-china/) about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.

For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those [are not immune](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/russia-forces-apple-to-remove-dozens-of-vpn-apps-from-app-store/) to the government’s crackdown either.
