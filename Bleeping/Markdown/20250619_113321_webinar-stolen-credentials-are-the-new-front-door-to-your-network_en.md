Cybercriminals no longer need zero-day exploits or other vulnerabilities to breach your systems—these days, they just log in.

On July 9th at 2:00 PM ET, BleepingComputer and SC Media will co-host a live webinar with identity security expert Darren Siegel of Specops Software (part of Outpost24), exploring how threat actors are increasingly breaching networks by simply logging in with stolen credentials.

The webinar "_[Stolen credentials: The New Front Door to Your Network](https://www.scworld.com/cybercast/stolen-credentials-the-new-front-door-to-your-network?utm%5Fsource=partner-campaign&utm%5Fmedium=bc%5Farticle&utm%5Fcampaign=sc-cybercast-bleepingcomputer-2025-july)_" will unpack the real-world mechanics behind credential-based attacks and how to stop them before damage is done.

Specops Software, part of Outpost24, brings expertise in password security and authentication controls, helping organizations defend against modern identity threats and credential-based intrusions.

In this must-watch webinar, you will learn how attackers are shifting from exploiting vulnerabilities to simply logging in using large-scale credential abuse, with insights into the infostealer economy and how enterprises can defend against these increasingly effective threats.​

Infostealer malware campaigns have [exploded in recent years](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/info-stealer/), stealing billions of credentials from infected systems and feeding a booming cybercrime marketplace.

These types of attacks are becoming the norm, with threat actors regularly buying stolen credentials for as little as a few dollars on Telegram and [dark web marketplaces](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/russian-market-emerges-as-a-go-to-shop-for-stolen-credentials/).

In other approaches, credentials are gathered using [password-spray attacks against Microsoft 365](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/botnet-targets-basic-auth-in-microsoft-365-password-spray-attacks/), weak MFA implementations using [adversary-in-the-middle phishing kits](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-rockstar-2fa-phishing-service-targets-microsoft-365-accounts/), and [brute-force VPN portals](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-basta-ransomware-creates-automated-tool-to-brute-force-vpns/) for initial access.

**The upcoming webinar will cover:**

* How infostealers harvest and distribute login credentials
* Methods used to bypass MFA and hijack sessions
* Techniques to detect compromised accounts and recover from breaches
* Strategies to harden identity surfaces and prevent lateral movement

The event will be hosted by Lawrence Abrams (BleepingComputer), Adrian Sanabria (SC Media), and Darren Siegel from Outpost24, the parent company of Specops Software.
