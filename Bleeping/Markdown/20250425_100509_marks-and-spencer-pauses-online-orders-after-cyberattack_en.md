British retailer giant Marks & Spencer (M&S) has suspended online orders while working to recover from a recently disclosed cyberattack.

The multinational retailer operates over 1,400 stores, employs 64,000 employees globally, and sells various products, including clothing, food, and home goods.

M&S, which reported revenues of Â£13 billion for FY24, is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and is included in the FTSE100 Index, the UK's best-known stock market index.

"As part of our proactive management of a cyber incident, we have made the decision to pause taking orders via our M&S.com websites and apps. Our product range remains available to browse online. We are truly sorry for this inconvenience. Our stores are open to welcome customers," the company [said in a Friday update](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/media/press-releases/cyber-incident-further-update-0).

"All orders will be held by stores for the foreseeable due to the ongoing cyber issues regardless of when the last date for collection is," it added in a [Twitter reply](https://x.com/marksandspencer/status/1915775788797878647) to a customer complaint.

On Wednesday, M&S also [informed customers](https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/media/press-releases/cyber-incident-further-update) that the cyberattack disrupted some of its services, including contactless payments and Click & Collect orders in stores, and it was also causing delays in online order delivery. The company also announced that the incident forced it to take some processes offline to protect partners, suppliers, and its business operations.

"We are incredibly grateful for the understanding and support that our customers, colleagues, partners and suppliers have shown. We are working hard to restore our services and minimise disruption and are being supported by industry-leading experts," it added.

M&S first [disclosed the cybersecurity incident](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/marks-and-spencer-confirms-a-cyberattack-as-customers-face-delayed-orders/) in a Tuesday London Stock Exchange press release, stating that its team is working with external cybersecurity experts to manage and resolve the situation.

No ransomware operations or other threat groups have claimed responsibility for the M&S attack, and an eventual data leak isn't expected soon because threat actors usually take some time to pressure victims into paying ransom demands.

However, if a ransomware gang has been behind this attack, its operators have likely stolen M&S data to be used as further extortion leverage.

BleepingComputer has contacted Marks & Spencer with questions about the attack earlier this week, and we'll update the story if we receive a reply.
